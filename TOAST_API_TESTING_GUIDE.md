# Toast API Tip Pool Automation - Testing Guide

**Date**: October 6, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Two New API Endpoints

**`/api/toast-sales-summary.js`**
- Fetches payment data from Toast for date range
- Extracts: Net Sales, Credit Tips, Cash Sales
- Processes all business dates in range
- Skips voided payments

**`/api/toast-labor-summary.js`**
- Fetches time entries from Toast Labor API
- Fetches employee names from Toast
- Calculates hours (regular + overtime)
- Calculates pay (OT at 1.5x rate)
- Returns data matching PayrollExport CSV format

### 2. Frontend "Fetch from API" Button
- Located in Tip Pool Calculator section
- Blue button below file upload fields
- Fetches both labor and sales data automatically
- Shows success message with data summary

2. Click "Tip Pool Calculator" button

### Step 2: Select Date Range
1. **Start Date**: 2025-09-29
2. **End Date**: 2025-10-05
3. This is the test period we have validation data for

### Step 3: Click "Fetch Data from Toast API"
1. Click the blue button that says "FETCH DATA FROM TOAST API"

3. Should see success message with:
   - Number of employees

   - Net sales amount

### Step 4: Verify Fetched Data
Compare API results with your validation files:

**Expected Labor Data** (from PayrollExport CSV):
- Should show 19 employees
- Total labor cost should match CSV total

**Expected Sales Data** (from SalesSummary ZIP):
- Credit tips: ~$2,675.93
- Cash sales: ~$2,257.92
- Net sales: Check against "Net sales summary.csv"

### Step 5: Complete Calculation
1. Enter **EZCater Tips**: $80.86 (from your test data)
2. Enter **Real Envelope Deposit**: $2,471.00 (from your test data)
3. Enter **Calculated By Name**: Your name
4. Click **"Calculate Tip Pool"**

### Step 6: Verify Results

## Troubleshooting

### If API Fetch Fails:

**Check Console Logs:**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for error messages
- Check network tab for API calls

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Labor API failed"** or **"Sales API failed"**
   - Check Toast API token is valid
   - Verify you have `labor:read` and `labor.employees:read` scopes
   - Check date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

2. **"Toast API access token not available"**
   - Make sure you're logged into Toast
   - Refresh the page
   - Check accessToken in localStorage

3. **No employees returned**
   - Check date range is correct
   - Verify employees worked during that period
   - Check Toast Labor API permissions

4. **Wrong amounts**
   - Compare with uploaded file results
   - Check for voided/refunded payments
   - Verify date range matches exactly

### Fallback to Files:
If API doesn't work, you can still:
1. Upload PayrollExport CSV manually
2. Upload SalesSummary ZIP manually
3. Calculate tip pool as before

## Next Steps After Testing

### If Successful:
1. Use API method going forward (no more file uploads!)
2. Monitor for any discrepancies
3. Report any calculation differences

### If Issues Found:
1. Report errors with details
2. Fall back to file upload method
3. I'll fix API endpoints based on feedback
