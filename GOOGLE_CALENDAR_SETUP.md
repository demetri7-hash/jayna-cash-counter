# Google Calendar Sync Setup

This guide explains how to set up Google Calendar integration for automatic catering order event creation.

## Features

When a catering order photo is uploaded, the system automatically:
- ‚úÖ Creates a Google Calendar event in `jaynascans@gmail.com`
- ‚úÖ Sets event title as "Order #1", "Order #2", etc. (dynamic based on same-day orders)
- ‚úÖ Sets event time to "leave jayna at" (delivery) or "time due" (pickup)
- ‚úÖ Adds 2-hour reminder before the event
- ‚úÖ Embeds order photo in event description
- ‚úÖ Stores calendar event ID for future updates/deletes

   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Name:** `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - **Value:** (copy the `private_key` value from JSON - include the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` parts)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

   **Variable 3:**
   - **Name:** `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`
   - **Value:** (copy the `project_id` value from JSON)

   **Variable 4:**
   - **Name:** `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID`
   - **Value:** (copy the `private_key_id` value from JSON)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

6. Click **Save** after each variable
7. **Redeploy** your app for changes to take effect

**Example of what to copy:**
```json
{
  "client_email": "jayna-catering-sync@project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com", ‚Üê Copy this
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvgIBADANBg...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n", ‚Üê Copy this (all of it)
  "project_id": "jayna-project-123", ‚Üê Copy this
  "private_key_id": "abc123def456" ‚Üê Copy this
}
```

### Step 7: Run Database Migration

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Open **SQL Editor**
3. Run the migration file:

```sql
-- Copy and paste contents of:
-- sql/alter_catering_photos_add_calendar_sync.sql
```

4. Verify columns were added:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'catering_photos'

```

You should see these new columns:
