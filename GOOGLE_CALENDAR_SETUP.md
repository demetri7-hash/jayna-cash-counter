# Google Calendar Sync Setup

This guide explains how to set up Google Calendar integration for automatic catering order event creation.

## Features

When a catering order photo is uploaded, the system automatically:
- ✅ Creates a Google Calendar event in `jaynascans@gmail.com`
- ✅ Sets event title as "Order #1", "Order #2", etc. (dynamic based on same-day orders)
- ✅ Sets event time to "leave jayna at" (delivery) or "time due" (pickup)
- ✅ Adds 2-hour reminder before the event
- ✅ Embeds order photo in event description
- ✅ Stores calendar event ID for future updates/deletes

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
3. Enter project name: **Jayna Catering Calendar**
4. Click "Create"

### Step 2: Enable Google Calendar API

1. In your project, go to **APIs & Services** → **Library**
2. Search for "Google Calendar API"
3. Click on it and press **Enable**

### Step 3: Create Service Account

1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Click **Create Credentials** → **Service Account**
3. Fill in details:
   - **Service account name:** `jayna-catering-sync`
   - **Service account ID:** (auto-filled)
   - **Description:** "Service account for syncing catering orders to Google Calendar"
4. Click **Create and Continue**
5. Skip optional role assignment (click **Continue**)
6. Click **Done**

### Step 4: Generate Service Account Key

1. In the **Credentials** page, find your new service account
2. Click on it to open details
3. Go to the **Keys** tab
4. Click **Add Key** → **Create new key**
5. Select **JSON** format
6. Click **Create**
7. A JSON file will download automatically - **SAVE THIS FILE SECURELY**

### Step 5: Share Calendar with Service Account

1. Open your service account JSON file
2. Find the `client_email` field (looks like: `jayna-catering-sync@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
3. **Copy** this email address
4. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) and log in as **jaynascans@gmail.com**
5. Find the calendar you want to sync to (or create a new "Catering Orders" calendar)
6. Click the 3 dots next to the calendar → **Settings and sharing**
7. Scroll to **Share with specific people**
8. Click **Add people**
9. Paste the service account email
10. Set permission to **Make changes to events**
11. Click **Send**

### Step 6: Add Credentials to Vercel

**IMPORTANT:** Don't try to paste the entire JSON - Vercel doesn't handle multi-line values well. Instead, add each field separately:

1. Open your downloaded JSON key file
2. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
3. Select your project: **jayna-cash-counter**
4. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
5. Add these **4 separate variables** (copy values from your JSON file):

   **Variable 1:**
   - **Name:** `GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - **Value:** (copy the `client_email` value from JSON)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

   **Variable 2:**
   - **Name:** `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - **Value:** (copy the `private_key` value from JSON - include the `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----` parts)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

   **Variable 3:**
   - **Name:** `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`
   - **Value:** (copy the `project_id` value from JSON)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

   **Variable 4:**
   - **Name:** `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID`
   - **Value:** (copy the `private_key_id` value from JSON)
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)

6. Click **Save** after each variable
7. **Redeploy** your app for changes to take effect

**Example of what to copy:**
```json
{
  "client_email": "jayna-catering-sync@project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com", ← Copy this
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvgIBADANBg...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n", ← Copy this (all of it)
  "project_id": "jayna-project-123", ← Copy this
  "private_key_id": "abc123def456" ← Copy this
}
```

### Step 7: Run Database Migration

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Open **SQL Editor**
3. Run the migration file:

```sql
-- Copy and paste contents of:
-- sql/alter_catering_photos_add_calendar_sync.sql
```

4. Verify columns were added:

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'catering_photos'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

You should see these new columns:
- `order_type`
- `order_due_date`
- `time_due`
- `leave_jayna_at`
- `calendar_event_id`

## Testing

### Test Calendar Event Creation

1. Go to **Catering** page on your app
2. Fill out the upload form:
   - Select **PICKUP** or **DELIVERY**
   - Set **ORDER DUE** date (e.g., tomorrow)
   - Set **TIME DUE** (e.g., 2:00 PM)
   - If DELIVERY, set **LEAVE JAYNA AT** (e.g., 1:30 PM)
3. Select a photo and upload
4. Check the console for:
   ```
   📋 Assigned order number: Order #1 for 2025-10-24
   📅 Creating Google Calendar event...
   ✅ Calendar event created: abc123xyz
   ```
5. Log in to Google Calendar as **jaynascans@gmail.com**
6. Navigate to the order date
7. You should see an event titled **"Order #1"**
8. Click the event to verify:
   - Time matches "leave jayna at" or "time due"
   - Description contains order details and photo
   - Reminder is set for 2 hours before

### Test Multiple Orders Same Day

1. Upload a second photo for the same date
2. Verify it's titled **"Order #2"**
3. Upload a third photo → **"Order #3"**, etc.

## Troubleshooting

### "Google service account credentials not configured"

**Fix:** Make sure `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables and redeploy.

### "Calendar event creation failed: Permission denied"

**Fix:**
1. Verify you shared the calendar with the service account email
2. Make sure permission is set to "Make changes to events"
3. Wait a few minutes for permissions to propagate

### "Failed to create calendar event"

**Fix:**
1. Check Vercel logs for detailed error message
2. Verify Google Calendar API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Verify service account JSON key is valid

### Events not appearing in calendar

**Fix:**
1. Verify you're logged in as **jaynascans@gmail.com**
2. Check if the event date is in the future
3. Refresh the calendar page
4. Check if the event was created in a different calendar
