# Long-term Feature Roadmap for Jayna Gyro Cash Counter

## ðŸ”§ Manager Historical Data Editing (Future Enhancement)

### Overview
Allow managers to edit historical data with full audit tracking and change logging.

### Requirements
- **Access Control**: Manager-level authentication required
- **Full Audit Trail**: Every change must be logged with:
  - Original value
  - New value  
  - Manager name/ID who made the change
  - Date and timestamp of change
  - Reason for change (required field)
- **Change History**: Complete revision history for each record
- **Approval Workflow**: Optional secondary approval for critical changes

### Technical Implementation
- Add `data_changes_log` table with:
  - `id`, `table_name`, `record_id`, `field_name`
  - `old_value`, `new_value`, `changed_by`, `changed_at`
  - `change_reason`, `approved_by`, `approved_at`
- Create manager authentication system
- Build editing interface with change reason requirements
- Implement revision history viewing
- Add change notifications/alerts

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Change approval workflow for sensitive data
- Automatic backup before any modifications
- Change limits (e.g., can't edit data older than 30 days without special approval)

### UI/UX Features
- Clear indication of edited data (modified badge/icon)
- Side-by-side comparison of original vs edited values
- Change history timeline view
- Export change log reports

### Priority: Low (Future Enhancement)
This feature should be implemented only after core business operations are stable and there's a demonstrated need for historical data corrections.
