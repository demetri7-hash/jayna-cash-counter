# Cashbox Reconciliation Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Data Available
- **Starting Cash (AM Total)**: Known each morning
- **Ending Cash (PM Total)**: Counted each evening  
- **Toast Sales**: System-reported sales
- **Cash Tips**: Staff-reported tips
- **Discrepancies**: Difference between expected vs actual cash
- **Excess**: Actual money returned to cashbox beyond starting amount

## Cashbox Reconciliation Formula
```
Expected Cashbox Balance = Previous Day End + Daily Excess - Next Day Start
```

## What We Can Calculate Now
1. **Daily Cash Flow**: `(PM Total - AM Total) - Toast Sales = Net Cash Movement`
2. **Cumulative Discrepancy**: Running total of all discrepancies
3. **Expected vs Actual**: Compare calculated balance with physical count

## Missing Data Points for Full Reconciliation
1. **Non-Toast Cash Sources**: 
   - Cash from other payment methods
   - Cash corrections/adjustments
   - Manual cash additions/removals

2. **Cash Outflows Not Captured**:
   - Change given for large bills
   - Petty cash expenses
   - Cash used for supplies

## Recommended Additions

### 1. Add "Other Cash In/Out" Field
Track any cash not from Toast sales:
- Manual cash additions
- Change transactions
- Petty cash usage

### 2. Add Beginning/Ending Cashbox Balance Tracking
- Track actual cashbox (not just drawer) amounts
- Separate from daily operational cash

### 3. Add Variance Analysis
Calculate expected vs actual for:
- Daily cash position
- Weekly cashbox accumulation
- Month-over-month trends

## Industry Best Practices

### Daily Reconciliation
1. **Three-Way Match**: Sales + Tips + Other = Cash Change
2. **Variance Threshold**: Flag discrepancies over $X
3. **Trend Analysis**: Track patterns in discrepancies

### Weekly/Monthly Reconciliation  
1. **Bank Deposits vs Expected**: Compare total deposits to calculated amounts
2. **Inventory of Physical Cash**: Count all cash locations
3. **Audit Trail**: Document all cash movements

## Proposed New Features

### 1. Cashbox Balance Tracker
Add to each day's report:
```
Previous Cashbox Balance: $XXX
Today's Excess Added: $XXX  
Expected New Balance: $XXX
Actual Counted Balance: $XXX
Variance: $XXX
```

### 2. Weekly Reconciliation Report
```
Week Starting Balance: $XXX
Total Excess Added: $XXX
Expected Ending Balance: $XXX
Actual Ending Balance: $XXX
Cumulative Variance: $XXX
```

### 3. Red Flag Alerts
- Discrepancies over threshold
- Negative cashbox balance
- Large unexplained variances

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. âœ… **Fix discrepancy formatting** (done)
2. âœ… **Remove cashbox column** (done)
3. ðŸ”„ **Add cashbox balance tracking fields**

### Medium Priority (Next)
1. **Variance threshold alerts**
2. **Weekly cashbox reconciliation**
3. **Trend analysis dashboard**

### Low Priority (Future)
1. **Monthly audit reports**
2. **Advanced analytics**
3. **Bank deposit reconciliation**

## Questions to Consider
1. **What's your acceptable variance threshold?** ($5? $10?)
2. **Do you have other cash sources?** (delivery fees, etc.)
3. **How often do you physically count the full cashbox?**
4. **Are there cash expenses not tracked?** (supplies, change, etc.)

This analysis shows you have most data needed for basic reconciliation, but adding cashbox balance tracking would provide complete visibility into your cash position.
