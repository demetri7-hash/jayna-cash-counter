# ðŸš¨ RUN THIS MIGRATION NOW - Complete Learning Columns

## The Problem

**Console Error:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 () (invoice_items, line 0)
Failed to save learning data
```

**Root Cause:** The `invoice_items` table is missing these columns:
- `detected_item_name`
- `detected_quantity`
- `match_confidence`
- `matched_at`
- `checked_in`
- `checked_in_at`

You ran the simpler migration earlier that only added `detected_price`, but you need ALL the learning columns!

## ðŸ”§ Solution: Run Complete Migration

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard
1. Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in left sidebar

### Step 2: Copy & Run This SQL

```sql
-- Migration: Add learning/matching columns to invoice_items table
-- Purpose: Store OCR detection data for machine learning and auto-matching
-- Date: 2025-10-12

-- Add detected item name (as seen in OCR before matching)
ALTER TABLE invoice_items
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS detected_item_name TEXT;

-- Add detected quantity (as seen in OCR)
ALTER TABLE invoice_items
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS detected_quantity NUMERIC;

-- Add detected price (already has migration, but include for completeness)
ALTER TABLE invoice_items
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS detected_price NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0;

-- Add match confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
ALTER TABLE invoice_items
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS match_confidence NUMERIC(3,2) DEFAULT 0;

-- Add timestamp when item was matched
ALTER TABLE invoice_items
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS matched_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Add flag for whether item has been physically checked in
ALTER TABLE invoice_items
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS checked_in BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Add timestamp when item was checked in
ALTER TABLE invoice_items
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS checked_in_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Add comments for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN invoice_items.detected_item_name IS 'Item name as detected by OCR before matching to inventory';
COMMENT ON COLUMN invoice_items.detected_quantity IS 'Quantity as detected by OCR';
COMMENT ON COLUMN invoice_items.detected_price IS 'Price detected from OCR scanning';
COMMENT ON COLUMN invoice_items.match_confidence IS 'Confidence score (0-1) of OCR match to inventory item';
COMMENT ON COLUMN invoice_items.matched_at IS 'Timestamp when OCR item was matched to inventory';
COMMENT ON COLUMN invoice_items.checked_in IS 'Whether this item has been physically checked in upon delivery';
COMMENT ON COLUMN invoice_items.checked_in_at IS 'Timestamp when item was checked in';

-- Create index for learning queries (find past matches by detected name)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoice_items_detected_name ON invoice_items(detected_item_name);

-- Create index for match confidence queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoice_items_match_confidence ON invoice_items(match_confidence) WHERE match_confidence > 0;

-- Create index for checked-in status queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_invoice_items_checked_in ON invoice_items(checked_in, checked_in_at);
```

### Step 3: Click "Run" (or Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)

You should see: **"Success. No rows returned"**

## âœ… What This Fixes

After running this migration:

1. **400 Error Gone** âœ…
   - No more "Failed to load resource" errors
   - Learning data saves successfully

2. **Complete Learning System** âœ…
   - Saves OCR-detected item names
   - Saves detected quantities
   - Saves detected prices
   - Saves match confidence scores
   - Timestamps for matching and check-in

3. **Future Auto-Matching** âœ…
   - System learns from every order you process
   - Next time same items appear, auto-match at 100%
   - Confidence improves over time

## ðŸ§ª Test After Migration

1. Go to app: https://jayna-cash-counter-git-main-demetri-gregorakis-projects.vercel.app
2. Upload a Performance PDF
3. Scan & Extract
4. Match items
5. Save Order
6. **Check console** - should see:
   ```
   ðŸ’¾ Saving matches to invoice_items for learning...
   âœ… Saved 13 matches for learning!
   ```

No more 400 errors!

## File Location

Migration file: `supabase/migrations/20251012172452_add_learning_columns_to_invoice_items.sql`

This is safe to run multiple times (uses `IF NOT EXISTS`).
