## üíº **BUSINESS LOGIC & MATHEMATICAL CORE**

### **The Problem This System Solves**
1. **Manual Errors**: Eliminates calculation mistakes in paper-based counting
2. **Accountability**: Tracks who performed each count with timestamps
3. **Data Loss**: Prevents lost count data with secure cloud storage
4. **Reporting Burden**: Automates comprehensive daily reports to management
5. **Deposit Confusion**: Provides clear, whole-dollar deposit amounts
6. **Mathematical Transparency**: Complete audit trail for all calculations

### **V2.84 Advanced Deposit Rounding System**

#### **Core Mathematical Logic**
```javascript
function calculatePMAmounts(amTotal, pmTotal, toastSales, cashTips) {
  // Step 1: Basic calculations
  const drawerChange = pmTotal - amTotal;
  const actualCashIn = toastSales + cashTips;
  const discrepancy = drawerChange - actualCashIn;
  
  // Step 2: Calculate raw deposit amount
  const rawDepositAmount = toastSales + cashTips;
  
  // Step 3: Round deposit to whole dollars for staff simplicity
  const depositAmount = Math.round(rawDepositAmount);
  const depositRoundingAdjustment = rawDepositAmount - depositAmount;
  
  // Step 4: Handle deposit rounding with tip adjustments
  let depositTipAdjustment = 0;
  let depositExcessToCashbox = 0;
  
  if (depositRoundingAdjustment > 0) {
    // Deposit rounded up - take whole dollars from tips
    depositTipAdjustment = Math.ceil(depositRoundingAdjustment);
    depositExcessToCashbox = depositTipAdjustment - depositRoundingAdjustment;
  } else if (depositRoundingAdjustment < 0) {
    // Deposit rounded down - staff keeps the rounding benefit
    depositExcessToCashbox = Math.abs(depositRoundingAdjustment);
  }
  
  // Step 5: Handle shortage/overage with whole dollar adjustments
  let shortageTipAdjustment = 0;
  let shortageExcessToCashbox = 0;
  
  if (discrepancy < 0) {
    // SHORTAGE: Take whole dollars from tips to cover
    const shortageAmount = Math.abs(discrepancy);
    shortageTipAdjustment = Math.ceil(shortageAmount);
    shortageExcessToCashbox = shortageTipAdjustment - shortageAmount;
  }
  
  // Step 6: Calculate final amounts
  const totalTipAdjustment = depositTipAdjustment + shortageTipAdjustment;
  let finalCashTips = cashTips - totalTipAdjustment;
  
  // Ensure tips don't go negative
  if (finalCashTips < 0) {
    finalCashTips = 0; // Track shortfall separately
  }
  
  // Final tips are always whole dollars
  const adjustedTips = Math.floor(finalCashTips);
  const tipDecimalRemainder = finalCashTips - adjustedTips;
  
  // Step 7: Calculate return amount to cashbox
  let returnAmount = amTotal;
  if (discrepancy > 0) returnAmount += discrepancy;
  returnAmount += depositExcessToCashbox + shortageExcessToCashbox + tipDecimalRemainder;
  
  return {
    // Core amounts
    depositAmount,    // Rounded deposit (what staff deposits)
    adjustedTips,     // Final whole dollar tips
    returnAmount,     // Amount returned to cashbox
    discrepancy,      // Over/under amount
    
    // Transparency tracking
    rawDepositAmount,
    depositRoundingAdjustment,
    depositTipAdjustment,
    depositExcessToCashbox,
    shortageTipAdjustment,
    shortageExcessToCashbox,
    tipDecimalRemainder
  };
}
```

#### **Mathematical Principles**
1. **Whole Dollar Simplicity**: Staff deal only with whole dollar amounts
2. **Perfect Balance**: Every penny is accounted for and tracked
3. **Tip Adjustments**: Tips absorb rounding differences to maintain balance
4. **Excess Management**: All excess amounts return to cashbox
5. **Complete Transparency**: Full audit trail for management oversight
