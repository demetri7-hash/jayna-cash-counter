# Updated PM Math Implementation - Test Results

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

### Changes Made:

1. **âœ… Updated `calculatePMAmounts()` function**:
   - Now rounds deposit amounts to whole dollars
   - Uses whole dollar tip adjustments for both deposit rounding and shortages
   - Sends excess adjustments to cashbox
   - Maintains mathematical consistency

2. **âœ… Updated `showPMSuccess()` display**:
   - Removed extra `Math.round()` since deposit is already rounded
   - Display now matches actual calculated amount

3. **âœ… Updated email template display**:
   - Removed `.toFixed(2)` from deposit amounts (line 2300)
   - Deposit now shows as whole dollar

4. **âœ… Updated report table displays**:
   - Removed `.toFixed(2)` from deposit amounts (line 2596)
   - Removed `.toFixed(2)` from total envelope deposits (line 2545)

### New Logic Flow:

For the example: Toast Sales $205.85, Cash Tips $20.00, Shortage -$1.00

1. **Raw Deposit**: $205.85 + $20.00 = $225.85
2. **Rounded Deposit**: $226.00 (what staff deposits)
3. **Deposit Rounding Adjustment**: $0.15 needed
4. **Deposit Tip Adjustment**: Take $1.00 (whole dollar)
5. **Deposit Excess to Cashbox**: $1.00 - $0.15 = $0.85
6. **Shortage Tip Adjustment**: Take $1.00 for shortage
7. **Final Cash Tips**: $20.00 - $1.00 - $1.00 = $18.00
8. **Total Cashbox Addition**: $0.85 (deposit excess)

### Result:
- Staff deposits: $226 (whole dollars)
- Staff gets: $18 tips (whole dollars)
- Cashbox gets: AM Total + $0.85 + any overage
- Restaurant gets: Exact Toast sales amount

### Key Benefits:
âœ… **Mathematical Consistency**: Display = Storage = Reality
âœ… **Whole Dollar Operations**: Easier cash handling for staff
âœ… **Business Benefit**: Rounding excess goes to cashbox
âœ… **Report Accuracy**: All reports now show consistent amounts
âœ… **Simplified Logic**: No more rounding discrepancies

## Ready for Testing! ðŸŽ¯

The system now implements the exact logic discussed:
- Deposit amounts are rounded to whole dollars
- Any rounding adjustments use whole dollar tip deductions
- Excess from adjustments goes to cashbox
- All displays show consistent amounts
