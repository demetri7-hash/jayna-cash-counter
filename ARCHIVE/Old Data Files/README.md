# Old Data Files Archive

This folder contains outdated data files that are no longer used by the live application.

## Contents

- `inventory-data.json` - Old inventory data (superseded by merged-inventory-data.json)
- `label-mappings.json` - Label mapping data (no longer referenced in app)

## Why Archived?

These data files are either outdated or no longer referenced by any active HTML pages or scripts. The current, live application uses different data sources.

**Active data files remain in the root directory:**
- `merged-inventory-data.json` - Current inventory data (used by scripts/import-inventory.js)
- `prep-list-config.json` - Active prep list configuration

**Note:** If you need to restore or reference historical data, these files are preserved here.
