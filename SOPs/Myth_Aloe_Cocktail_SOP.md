## Jayna Gyro Signature Cocktail

---

## 🌊 THE STORY: MYTHOLOGY & FEELING

### The Name & Inspiration
**"Myth + Aloe"** embodies the essence of Greek island life—where ancient legends meet natural healing. This cocktail is a journey through the Aegean:

- **MYTH**: References the timeless Greek mythology that flows through every island. Just as sailors once sought glory (*kleos*) across these waters, this drink captures that spirit of adventure and legendary taste.

- **ALOE**: Represents the soothing, healing botanicals that grow wild on sun-drenched Greek islands. Aloe vera has been used since ancient times as a remedy and refreshment—a symbol of Mediterranean wellness.

### The Experience
This cocktail should transport guests to:
- A **sunset in Santorini** - bright, botanical, sophisticated
- The **legends of ancient heroes** - bold yet refined
- **Mediterranean gardens** - fresh citrus groves and wild herbs

When you serve this drink, you're offering a taste of *kleos* (glory) in a glass.

6. Set aside while you build the drink

### STEP 2: Build the Cocktail
1. **Muddle**: Take 1 lemon rind (peeled top to bottom) and place in shaker

   - 0.75 oz Chareau
5. Fill shaker with ice
