## üéØ KEY FINDINGS

### Project Identity
**Jayna Cash Counter** - Restaurant management platform combining:
- Cash counting system (AM/PM dual-drawer workflows)
- Tip pool calculator with Toast POS integration
- Automated daily reporting via EmailJS
- Manager analytics dashboard
- Labor management through Homebase API

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Backend: Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- APIs: Toast POS, Homebase
- Deployment: Vercel (https://jayna-cash-counter.vercel.app)

### Critical System Components
1. **V2.84 Deposit Rounding Logic** - Whole dollar deposits with tip adjustments
2. **TDS Driver Integration** - GUID `5ffaae6f-4238-477d-979b-3da88d45b8e2`, $481.83 weekly
3. **Full Order Pagination** - Fixed Oct 1, 2025 to fetch ALL orders (not just 100)
4. **Security Architecture** - No hardcoded secrets, environment variables only

### Recent Critical Fixes
- **Oct 1:** Toast pagination (ALL orders for accurate analytics)
- **Oct 1:** Homebase security (removed hardcoded UUIDs)
- **Sep 30:** TDS Driver fix ($481.83 accuracy with comprehensive analysis)
- **Sep 1:** V2.84 deposit rounding system

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS FOR FUTURE SESSIONS

### At Start of Every Session:
1. ‚úÖ Read **AI_PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** (this is now your startup guide)
2. ‚úÖ Read **PROJECT_MASTER_LOG.md** (newest entries first)
3. ‚úÖ Read **CURRENT_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md** (system overview)
4. ‚úÖ Ask user: "What are we working on today?"
5. ‚úÖ Create **START_POINT_[DATE].md** after user confirms
6. ‚úÖ Update **PROJECT_MASTER_LOG.md** with new session entry

### Documentation Maintenance:
- Update PROJECT_MASTER_LOG.md at start/end of each session
- Keep CURRENT_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md updated with major changes
- Create START_POINT files for context continuity
- Update PROCESS_LOG.md for technical change details

### Optional Cleanup:
- Remove "instructions for ai.txt" (original template, no longer needed)
- Archive this SESSION_SUMMARY file after reviewing

---

## üîê CRITICAL REMINDERS

### Security (NEVER FORGET):
- ‚ùå NEVER commit .env file
- ‚ùå NEVER hardcode API keys, secrets, or UUIDs in frontend
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use environment variables
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS test locally before pushing
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS verify Vercel deployment after push

### Testing:
- ‚úÖ Test locally: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- ‚úÖ Test production: https://jayna-cash-counter.vercel.app
- ‚úÖ Manual testing required (no automated tests yet)
- ‚úÖ This is a LIVE PRODUCTION SYSTEM used daily
