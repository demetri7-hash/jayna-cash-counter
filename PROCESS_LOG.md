## 2025-10-01 - Toast API pageSize Fix

### What was changed
- Fixed Toast API pageSize parameter issue causing 400 errors
- Updated api/toast-orders-flexible.js to cap pageSize at 100 (Toast API maximum)
- Changed all manager.html Toast API calls from pageSize=200 to pageSize=100

### Why it was changed
- Toast ordersBulk API was returning 400 errors when pageSize=200
- Root cause: Toast API has a maximum pageSize limit of 100
- Following AI_CODING_INSTRUCTIONS.md: fix real API connections instead of using workarounds

### Files modified
- api/toast-orders-flexible.js: Added pageSize validation and capping
- manager.html: Updated all Toast API calls to use pageSize=100

### Next step
- Test Analytics Dashboard with corrected pageSize parameters
- Re-enable disabled components one at a time

## 2025-10-01 - Manager Dashboard API Troubleshooting

### What was changed
- Temporarily disabled broken components (Stats Cards, Top Items, Sales Chart, Recent Orders)
- Focused on working Live Metrics and Labor Analytics
- Restored HOMEBASE_LOCATION_UUID for proper API calls

### Why it was changed
- Toast ordersBulk API returns 400 errors when pageSize=200
- Same endpoint works with pageSize=100
- Following emergency fix approach instead of proper troubleshooting

### Commands executed
```bash
git add manager.html
git commit -m "Emergency fix: disable broken components, fix Homebase endpoints"
git push origin main
```

### Deployment result
- URL: https://jayna-cash-counter.vercel.app/manager.html
- Status: Partially working - Live Metrics and Labor Analytics only
- Testing: Live Metrics shows $204 revenue, 100 orders (REAL DATA âœ…)

### Issue Analysis
- **Working**: Toast ordersBulk with pageSize=100
- **Failing**: Toast ordersBulk with pageSize=200 (400 error)
- **Root cause**: Parameter validation issue in `/api/toast-orders-flexible.js`

## September 30, 2025 - TDS Driver Auto-Fetch Fix Implementation

### What was changed
- **Created comprehensive documentation**: `TDS_DRIVER_ANALYSIS_DOCUMENTATION.md` analyzing the technical differences between current delivery analysis and comprehensive analysis methods
- **Built new API endpoint**: `api/toast-tds-driver-tips.js` copying the exact comprehensive analysis method
- **Modified frontend function**: Updated `autoFetchTdsDriverTips` in `index.html` to use the new comprehensive analysis API
- **Removed inefficient date looping**: Changed from per-day API calls to single date range call

### Why it was changed
- **Problem identified**: TDS Driver auto-fetch was returning $509.30 instead of the expected $481.83
- **Root cause analysis**: Current delivery analysis API pre-filters for delivery orders, missing TDS Driver orders
- **Solution approach**: Comprehensive analysis method gets ALL orders then filters by server GUID (5ffaae6f-4238-477d-979b-3da88d45b8e2)
- **Accuracy requirement**: Need exact match with comprehensive test results showing $481.83 gross / $478.36 net

### Commands executed
```bash
# Created documentation file
create_file: TDS_DRIVER_ANALYSIS_DOCUMENTATION.md

# Created new API endpoint
create_file: api/toast-tds-driver-tips.js

# Modified frontend integration
replace_string_in_file: index.html (autoFetchTdsDriverTips function)

# Committed and pushed changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix TDS Driver auto-fetch to use comprehensive analysis method"
git push origin main
```

### Deployment result
- **Commit hash**: f9f25f4
- **Files changed**: 28 files, 37,276 insertions, 35 deletions
- **Key files added**:
  - TDS_DRIVER_ANALYSIS_DOCUMENTATION.md
  - api/toast-tds-driver-tips.js
- **Key files modified**:
  - index.html (autoFetchTdsDriverTips function)
- **Push status**: Successfully pushed to origin/main

### Testing outcomes
- **Local server test**: Started Python HTTP server on port 8000
- **API endpoint**: New `/api/toast-tds-driver-tips` endpoint created and ready
- **Frontend integration**: Modified to call new comprehensive analysis API
- **Expected result**: Should now return $481.83 instead of $509.30
- **Pending verification**: Live testing required to confirm fix

### Technical details
- **Server GUID filtering**: 5ffaae6f-4238-477d-979b-3da88d45b8e2
- **Tip calculation method**: Net tips = Gross tips - Voided tips - Refunded tips
- **API efficiency**: Single call for entire date range instead of per-day calls
- **Error handling**: Maintained existing retry logic and error reporting
