## 📸 Ready for Your Invoices!

**You can start scanning now!** The system is ready to:
1. Accept your invoice photos
2. Extract data with OCR
3. Store in database
4. Build ordering patterns

## 💡 Technical Notes

### Invoice Parser Intelligence
The OCR parser uses regex patterns to extract:
- Dates (MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)
- Invoice numbers (various formats)
- Totals (with/without $, various labels)
- Line items (description, qty, price)

It will improve as you provide more real invoices. We can tune the patterns based on your specific vendor formats.

### Order Alerts Algorithm
- Checks current day of week
- Queries `order_schedules` table
- Calculates time until cutoff
- Sorts by priority + urgency
- Includes next 3 days of upcoming orders

### Suggested Orders Logic
Currently based on:
- Par level - Current stock = Deficit
- Urgency: <25% = CRITICAL, <50% = HIGH
- Will enhance with historical usage patterns as data accumulates
