# CURRENT STATUS - Jayna Cash Counter
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-09 (OCR Improvements + Editable Line Items Session)

---

## üéØ Current Work Status
**Status:** ‚úÖ COGs Invoice OCR - Editable Items + Preprocessing Complete

### Recently Completed (This Session):

- ‚úÖ **Editable Line Items with Delete Buttons**
  - Replaced read-only table with fully editable input fields (description, qty, price)
  - Added red ‚úï delete buttons for each line item with confirmation
  - Added "+ Add Line Item" button to manually insert missing items
  - Users can now correct all OCR extraction errors

- ‚úÖ **Prominent Invoice Date Display**
  - Large blue/red header bar showing date, vendor, invoice number
  - Format: "Sep 4, 2025 ‚Ä¢ Mani Imports Inc. ‚Ä¢ #0078866-IN"
  - Makes physical invoice matching easy during bulk upload
  - Enhanced date extraction with 6 different patterns

- ‚úÖ **Page Preview Images**
  - Saved canvas as JPEG data URL (70% quality for low file size)
  - Clickable preview images for each page
  - Click to view full-size in new tab
  - Auto-deleted after save to free memory

- ‚úÖ **Better Line Item Parsing**
  - Skip patterns filter out junk: Lot Number, Salesperson, headers
  - Better validation: price > $0.50, description > 5 chars
  - Prevents invoice headers from being extracted as items

- ‚úÖ **Research-Based OCR Preprocessing** (CRITICAL FIX)
  - Replaced aggressive binarization with gentle Gaussian blur (3x3 kernel)
  - Changed to PSM 4 (single column - optimal for invoice columnar data)
  - Enabled auto-rotation detection (rotate_enabled: true)
  - Added character whitelist for invoice data
  - Gentle 1.2x contrast (no artifacts from hard thresholding)

### In Progress:
- üß™ **User Testing Required** - OCR accuracy improvements need real invoice validation

### Next Session TODO:
- üìä **Test OCR Improvements** - User to test with real invoice PDFs
  - Verify accuracy improvements from preprocessing changes
  - If insufficient, implement Scribe.js (40-90% slower but more accurate)

- üì∏ **COGs Day 2 Continuation** - Additional invoice scanning features
  - Vendor auto-detection refinement
  - Invoice history view
  - Batch processing optimization

- üìä **COGs Day 3: Daily Counts & Reporting**
  - Camera-assisted inventory counting
  - Manual adjustment workflow
  - COGs calculation engine
  - Food cost % reporting
  - Variance analysis (theoretical vs actual)
  - Timeline: 8-10 hours

## üöß Blockers & Issues
**Current Blockers:** None

### User Testing Required:
1. **OCR Accuracy Validation** - CRITICAL TESTING PHASE
   - User needs to test with real invoice PDFs
   - Verify preprocessing improvements (Gaussian blur, PSM 4, auto-rotation)
   - If accuracy still insufficient, implement Scribe.js as fallback
   - User is doing bulk scanning to build dataset

### Technical Notes:
- OCR preprocessing changed from aggressive threshold to gentle blur
- PSM 4 (single column) optimal for invoice columnar data
- Auto-rotation detection enabled
- Page images auto-deleted after save to conserve memory
- All edits saved directly to extractedInvoices array (no backend needed)

---

## üîú Next Session Should Start With:
1. **Read last 3 RTF chat sessions** from `/chat sessions/` folder
2. **Ask user for OCR testing results** - Did accuracy improve?
3. **If accuracy good:** Continue with COGs features (vendor refinement, invoice history)
4. **If accuracy insufficient:** Implement Scribe.js (research shows 40-90% slower but more accurate)
5. **Next major feature:** COGs Day 3 - Daily counts & reporting

## üîê Security Notes
**Environment Variables:** All configured (no changes needed)
**Secrets Status:** ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in codebase
**Database:** All COGs tables have RLS disabled for app access

## üí° Key Implementation Details

### OCR Preprocessing Pipeline (v6.1 - October 2025):

**WRONG Approach (Removed):**
```javascript
// ‚ùå Created artifacts in whitespace
value = value > threshold ? 255 : 0;  // Hard binarization
```

**CORRECT Approach (Current):**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Gentle denoising without artifacts
1. Grayscale conversion
2. Light Gaussian blur (3x3 kernel) - removes noise
3. Gentle contrast enhancement (1.2x) - no hard threshold
4. Auto-rotation detection (rotate_enabled: true)
5. PSM 4: Single column (optimal for invoice columnar data)
6. Character whitelist: alphanumeric + invoice symbols
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Aggressive binarization made accuracy WORSE
- Research showed proper preprocessing = gentle blur, not hard thresholding
- PSM 4 specifically designed for invoice table layouts
- Auto-rotation handles skewed scans without manual deskewing

### Editable Line Items:
- **Input Fields:** Description, quantity, price fully editable
- **Delete Button:** Red ‚úï on each row with confirmation dialog
- **Add Button:** "+ Add Line Item" creates blank rows
- **Live Updates:** Changes immediately reflected in extractedInvoices array
- **Purpose:** User can fix ALL OCR extraction errors manually

### COGs System Architecture:

**Database Tables:**
```
inventory_items       - Product master list
vendors              - Supplier information
invoices             - Scanned invoice metadata
invoice_items        - Line items from invoices
inventory_counts     - Daily/weekly snapshots
cogs_reports         - Generated analysis
usage_tracking       - Theoretical vs actual
count_schedules      - Count reminders
```

**Page Structure (cogs.html):**
```
Navigation (persistent)
‚Üì
Dashboard (active by default)
  - Quick Actions (4 buttons)
  - This Week Summary (placeholder)
‚Üì
Hidden Sections (display: none)
  - Manage Items
  - Scan Invoice (Day 2)
  - Daily Count (Day 3)
  - View Reports (Day 3)
  - Item Form
```

**Display Pattern (copied from index.html):**
- Dashboard: `class="active"` in HTML (visible on load)
- Other sections: `style="display: none"` inline
- No data loads on page load (only when user clicks)
- `showSection(id)` hides all, shows selected

### Labor Cost Discrepancy Analysis:
```
Toast Web:      $9,637.82
API Calculated: $9,494.68
Difference:     $143.14

Cause: CA double-time overtime (2x pay for >12hrs/day)
      Toast API only provides total overtimeHours
      Cannot separate 1.5x from 2x overtime

Examples:
Huseyin: 26.9 OT hrs @ avg 1.78x (mix of 1.5x and 2x)
Dilan:   16.4 OT hrs @ avg 1.56x (mostly 1.5x, some 2x)

Solution: Manual input field for accurate Toast web total
```
