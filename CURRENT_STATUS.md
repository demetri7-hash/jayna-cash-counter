## üéØ Current Work Status
**Status:** ‚úÖ **ALL FIXES DEPLOYED - OCR SYSTEM ENHANCED**

### Session (October 12, 2025):

#### **‚úÖ OCR INVOICE/ORDER SYSTEM - FULLY ENHANCED** ‚úÖ
**User Request:** Fix console errors + add PDF support + always show action buttons + improve price extraction
**Implementation:** Complete enhancements to invoice/order receiving flow
**Result:** **FULLY WORKING** - All issues resolved

**Fixes Completed:**

1. **Database Migration** ‚úÖ
   - Added `detected_price NUMERIC(10,2)` column to `invoice_items` table
   - User ran migration successfully in Supabase
   - Learning system now saves prices for future matching
   - Migration files created in `database/migrations/` and `supabase/migrations/`

2. **PDF Upload Support** ‚úÖ
   - File input now accepts: `image/*,application/pdf`
   - `handleInvoiceUpload()` function processes PDFs
   - Shows PDF preview indicator with filename
   - PDFs processed through Tesseract OCR same as images

3. **Action Buttons Always Visible** ‚úÖ
   - MATCH/CHANGE, ADD NEW, and SKIP buttons now ALWAYS show
   - Works even at 100% confidence matches
   - User has full control to rematch or skip any item
   - Removed conditional hiding logic

4. **Improved Price Extraction** ‚úÖ
   - Better regex patterns for Performance Order format
   - Pattern 1: `CS $XX.XX` (unit price)
   - Pattern 2: `$XX.XX` anywhere in line (with range check 0.01-1000)
   - Pattern 3: Numeric prices after "CS" or "Confirmed" (fallback)
   - Extended search range to next 7 lines
   - More detailed console logging

**Technical Changes:**
- `handleInvoiceUpload()`: Now accepts and displays PDFs (lines 14906-14975)
- `parsePerformanceOrder()`: Enhanced price extraction (lines 15160-15206)
- `renderExtractedItems()`: Buttons always append (lines 15427-15520)
- Price input always editable (line 15546)

**Commits:**
- `e9fcbd3`: feat(receive): Add PDF upload + improve price extraction + always show action buttons
- `a803c3b`: feat(database): Add supabase migration for learning columns
- `1141e86`: fix(receive): Add PDF-to-image conversion for OCR processing ‚Üê **CRITICAL FIX**
- `703e820`: feat(receive): Process ALL pages of multi-page PDFs for OCR ‚Üê **MAJOR ENHANCEMENT**
- `4a62d77`: fix(receive): Smart line skipping - prevents missing items like Sprite ‚Üê **BUG FIX**

**Critical Fix Applied (1141e86):**
- **Problem:** Tesseract.js cannot read PDFs directly (Error: "Error attempting to read image")
- **Solution:** Added PDF.js library to convert PDF ‚Üí Image ‚Üí Tesseract
- **How it works:**
  1. Detects PDF files by checking `data:application/pdf` prefix
  2. Converts PDF to Uint8Array using atob()
  3. Loads PDF with pdfjsLib.getDocument()
  4. Renders first page to canvas at 2x scale (high quality)
  5. Converts canvas to PNG data URL
  6. Passes PNG to Tesseract for OCR
- **Libraries:** PDF.js v3.11.174 + worker

**Multi-Page PDF Support (703e820):**
- **Problem:** Only processing page 1 of multi-page PDFs (Performance orders have 3 pages)
- **Missing items:** Items from pages 2 and 3 were not being extracted
- **Solution:** Process ALL pages and combine text
- **How it works:**
  1. `convertPdfToImages()` loops through ALL pages (not just page 1)
  2. Each page converted to separate PNG image
  3. Tesseract OCR runs on each page individually
  4. Progress shows: "Page 1/3: 45%", "Page 2/3: 78%", etc.
  5. Text from all pages combined with spacing: `text1 + "\n\n" + text2 + "\n\n" + text3`
  6. Combined text parsed by `parseInvoiceText()` to extract all items
- **Result:** Now captures ALL items from ALL pages of PDF ‚úÖ

**Smart Line Skipping (4a62d77):**
- **Problem:** Sprite item missing from extraction despite being in PDF
- **Root cause:** Fixed skip of 3 lines didn't account for "Information: Split Case" lines
- **Variable spacing:** Some items have 3 lines, some have 4-5 with Information lines
- **Solution:** Dynamic skip that searches for NEXT SKU pattern
- **How it works:**
  1. After processing item, search forward for next 6-digit SKU
  2. Skip to line before SKU (the item name line)
  3. Handles any spacing: Information lines, blank lines, etc.
  4. Console logs show: "‚Üí Skipping X lines to next item"
- **Result:** No more missed items! All 15 items extracted ‚úÖ

**Philosophy Applied:** "Always go forward, never backwards"
- Added PDF support instead of restricting to images only
- Added database column instead of removing feature
- Added button visibility instead of removing user control
- Added PDF conversion instead of blocking PDF uploads

### Session (October 11, 2025):

#### **‚úÖ INVOICE CHECK-IN SYSTEM - SUCCESSFULLY REBUILT** ‚úÖ
**User Request:** Rebuild invoice upload/OCR/manual matching system (after Oct 10 emergency revert)
**Implementation:** Complete rebuild using DOM-based approach (no template literals)
**Result:** **FULLY WORKING** - All features operational

**What Was Built:**
- Invoice upload system with separate camera/file buttons
- OCR text extraction using Tesseract.js v4
- Fuzzy matching algorithm (0.4 confidence threshold)
- DOM-based manual matching modal (100% safe)
- Confidence badges in grayscale (darker = higher confidence)
- Check-in flow updates inventory automatically
- Base64 image processing (no database storage)

**Technical Approach:**
- Pure DOM manipulation (createElement, appendChild) throughout
- Zero template literals (eliminated previous failure mode)
- Searchable vendor-grouped dropdown for manual item selection
- Real-time filtering by item name or vendor
- Validates all items matched before check-in
- Updates current_stock and last_counted_date
- Clears image from memory after check-in

**Space Saving:**
- Images processed in memory only (Base64)
- NO images saved to database
- Only text extracted (item names, quantities, prices, confidence scores)
- ~1-2KB per invoice vs ~500KB if saving images
- Zero image storage costs

#### **‚úÖ COMPLETE STYLING OVERHAUL** ‚úÖ
**User Request:** "TOO MANY EMOJIS AND COLORS, MAKE IT MATCH THE REST OF THE APP"
**Implementation:** Removed all emojis, changed from colorful to monochromatic gray design
**Result:** Clean, professional, unified design system

**Changes:**
- **Removed ALL emojis** from tabs, buttons, headers, cards, modals
- **Color scheme:** Bright colors (blue/green/red/yellow/orange) ‚Üí Monochromatic gray
- **Typography:** ALL CAPS with consistent letter-spacing (0.5px-1.2px)
- **Borders:** border-radius 8px/12px ‚Üí 0 (sharp corners)
- **Borders:** 1px ‚Üí 2px for better definition
- **Buttons:** Uniform gray styling using CSS variables (--gray-100, --gray-300, --gray-700)
- **Confidence badges:** Color-coded ‚Üí Grayscale intensity
- **Font sizes:** Standardized 10px-14px range
- **Font weights:** Increased to 700 for readability

#### **‚úÖ OTHER IMPROVEMENTS** ‚úÖ

**1. Mobile Tab Optimization:**
- Reduced padding: 10px 12px ‚Üí 8px 6px
- Reduced min-width: 100px ‚Üí 70px
- All 5 tabs now fit on screen (358px total, fits 375px iPhone SE)
- No horizontal scrolling needed

**2. Sticky Tab Navigation:**
- Tabs stick to top of viewport when scrolling
- Implemented with wrapper pattern (outer=sticky, inner=scrollable)
- Works with horizontal tab scrolling independently

**3. Unit Editing:**
- Unit column now editable in COUNT tab
- Click to edit, auto-uppercase (CS, EA, LB)
- Saves to database immediately
- Updates for both inventory and prep items

**4. Tab Reorganization:**
- Renamed "MANAGE" ‚Üí "COUNT" (clearer purpose)
- Moved Count Session Selector from UPDATE tab ‚Üí PREP tab
- Better logical organization (prep tools with prep recommendations)

**5. Button Improvements:**
- Split single upload button into two: "TAKE PHOTO" + "UPLOAD"
- Equal sizing (both 14px padding, max-width 200px)
- Changed wording: "Upload Image" ‚Üí "UPLOAD"

**6. Critical Bug Fix:**
- Fixed missing quotes around CSS variables (line 12007-12008)
- Was causing "Unexpected keyword 'var'" syntax error
- Entire ordering system broken until fixed
