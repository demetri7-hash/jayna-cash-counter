## üÜï FOH WATCHDOG MANAGER FEATURES - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

**Session Date:** October 18, 2025
**Commit:** `7678ef6` - feat(foh): Add Watchdog manager features - notes, delete, enhanced audit

### Three Major Features Implemented:

#### 1. Enhanced Username Audit Trail ‚úÖ
**Problem:** User reported not seeing who completed tasks in Watchdog
**Investigation:** Code was already saving `completed_by` correctly!
**Solution:** Enhanced visibility + added debugging

**Changes Made:**
- Added console logging to verify `completed_by` data exists in database
- Improved task display in Watchdog:
  - ‚úÖ Completed tasks: **Green bold** "‚úì Completed by [name] ‚Ä¢ [time]"
  - ‚¨ú Incomplete tasks: **Red bold** "‚ö†Ô∏è NOT COMPLETED"
- Debug logs in console:
  ```
  üìä Watchdog Tasks Loaded: X tasks
  ‚úÖ Completed tasks with username: X
  Sample completed task: {...}
  ```

**Why username wasn't visible:**
- Old checklist sessions created before username feature
- New sessions WILL show usernames correctly

**Code Location:** `foh-checklists.html:1994-2000, 2137-2199`

---

#### 2. Manager Notes on Individual Tasks ‚úÖ
**Feature:** Managers can add notes/observations to specific tasks

**Implementation:**
- Textarea field below each task in Watchdog
- Auto-saves on blur (when clicking/tabbing away)
- Tracks audit trail:
  - `manager_note` - Note text
  - `manager_note_by` - Username from localStorage
  - `manager_note_at` - Timestamp of last edit
- Visual feedback:
  - Green border flash on successful save
  - Shows edit history: "Last edited by [name] ‚Ä¢ [date/time]"

**Code Location:** `foh-checklists.html:2163-2196, 2271-2310`

**Database Schema Required:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE foh_checklist_tasks
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS manager_note TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS manager_note_by TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS manager_note_at TIMESTAMP;
```

---

#### 3. Delete Session Button ‚úÖ
**Feature:** Password-protected session deletion with cascade

**Implementation:**
- Red "üóëÔ∏è DELETE SESSION" button in each session header
- Two-step protection:
  1. Requires ADMIN_PASSWORD (`JaynaGyro2025!`)
  2. Shows confirmation modal with warning
- Cascade deletion (proper order):
  1. Delete all ratings for session
  2. Delete all tasks for session
  3. Delete session itself
- Auto-refresh Watchdog after deletion
- Allows fresh checklist creation in Public tab

**Code Location:** `foh-checklists.html:2085-2105, 2312-2469`

## üìã Required Actions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Database Schema Update
**Status:** Required before manager notes will work

**Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE foh_checklist_tasks
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS manager_note TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS manager_note_by TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS manager_note_at TIMESTAMP;
```

**Why:** Manager notes feature stores data in these columns. Without them, save will fail.
