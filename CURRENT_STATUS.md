## üéØ Current Work Status
**Status:** üîÑ In Progress - Implementing Toast API auto-fetch for tip pool calculator

### Recently Completed (This Session):
- ‚úÖ **Tip Variance Tracking System** - Implemented rolling variance tracker for tip compliance
  - Fetches previous week's unpaid variance from database
  - Adds carryover to current week's tip pool
  - Displays variance in UI with orange warning badge
  - Shows carryover in BOTH PDFs (Tip Pool + Combined Report)
  - Saves final variance after equity adjustments
  - Comprehensive console logging for debugging

- ‚úÖ **Database Fixes**
  - Created `tip_variance` table SQL schema
  - Fixed missing `overtime_hours` and `regular_hours` columns in `weekly_employee_tips`
  - Added RLS permissions documentation

- ‚úÖ **Session Continuity System**
  - Created CURRENT_STATUS.md
  - Created SESSION_END_CHECKLIST.md
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory session end protocol

- ‚úÖ **Email Parser Analysis** - Determined email parsing NOT viable
  - Analyzed Toast "Daily Performance Summary" email
  - Confirmed email does NOT contain payment tender data (credit/cash totals)
  - Confirmed email does NOT contain tip data
  - Only shows: Net Sales, Gross Sales, Discounts, Voids, Refunds
  - Weekly Performance Summary might have data, but not available until Monday
  - **Decision:** Abandon email parser approach, use Toast API instead

- ‚úÖ **Toast API Auto-Fetch Verified** - ALREADY FULLY IMPLEMENTED
  - Auto-fetch triggers when user selects end date (if no files uploaded)
  - Priority 1: Check database for automated imports (instant)
  - Priority 2: Fallback to Toast API if database empty (1-2 min)
  - Manual file upload works as fallback (bypasses database + API)
  - System working exactly as designed

### In Progress:
- None - email parser analysis complete, API auto-fetch verified working

## üöß Blockers & Issues
**Current Blockers:** None

### User Action Required:
1. **Run SQL in Supabase** (if not done):
   - `create_tip_variance_table.sql` - Creates tip_variance table
   - `fix_weekly_employee_tips_columns.sql` - Adds overtime/regular hours columns
   - Disable RLS on tip_variance: `ALTER TABLE tip_variance DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`

### Technical Notes:
- 406 error on first run is EXPECTED (no previous variance exists yet)
- After first PDF generation, variance will be saved for next week
- Variance saves on BOTH buttons: "Download Tip Pool PDF" AND "Generate Combined Report"

---

## üîú Next Session Should Start With:
1. Read this file first to understand current state
2. Verify Supabase tables are created (tip_variance, weekly_employee_tips columns)
3. Test the variance tracking workflow:
   - Calculate tip pool
   - Click "Generate Combined Report"
   - Check console for variance save logs
   - Verify variance appears in database
4. Next week: Verify previous variance carryover appears

## üìä Production System Health
**Last Deployed:** 2025-10-08 (Multiple deploys - all successful)
**URL:** https://jayna-cash-counter.vercel.app
**Status:** ‚úÖ Operational

### Recent Deployments:
- Variance tracking system (LIVE)
- Session continuity docs (LIVE)
- Database schema fixes (SQL files ready to run)

---

## üîê Security Notes
**Environment Variables:** All configured (no changes needed)
**Secrets Status:** ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in codebase
**Database:** tip_variance table needs RLS disabled for app access

---

## üí° Key Implementation Details

### Tip Variance System:
- **Fetch:** `.lt('week_ending_date', endDate)` - only previous weeks
- **Save:** `.upsert(record, { onConflict: 'week_ending_date' })` - overwrites duplicates
- **Display:** Shows in UI when previousVariance > 0
- **PDFs:** Appears at top of tip pool summary in both PDFs
- **Calculation:** `pool - totalPaidOut = variance` (after equity adjustments)

### Expected Workflow:
```
Week 1: No carryover ‚Üí Calculate ‚Üí Save $8.00 variance
Week 2: Fetches $8.00 ‚Üí Adds to pool ‚Üí Save new variance
Week 3: Fetches Week 2 variance ‚Üí Adds to pool ‚Üí Continues...
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT FOR NEXT CLAUDE:**
- Variance tracking is COMPLETE and DEPLOYED
- User only uses "Generate Combined Report" button (not "Download Tip Pool PDF")
- Variance saves on BOTH buttons for redundancy
- First run will show 406 error (expected - no previous data)
- Check console logs for detailed variance tracking info
