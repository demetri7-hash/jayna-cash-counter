# CURRENT STATUS - Jayna Cash Counter
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10 (Emergency Session: Invoice System Revert)

---

## üéØ Current Work Status
**Status:** ‚úÖ **SYSTEM RESTORED - ALL CORE FEATURES OPERATIONAL**

### Emergency Session (October 10, 2025 - Late Evening):

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è INVOICE MANUAL MATCHING ATTEMPTED - REVERTED** ‚ùå
**User Request:** Add manual matching feature for low-confidence invoice items
**Implementation:** Modal with searchable dropdown for manual inventory matching
**Result:** **CATASTROPHIC FAILURE** - Emergency revert required

**What Went Wrong:**
- Modal HTML generation caused complete page break
- Raw JavaScript code displayed as text on page load
- Modal appeared automatically on page refresh
- Multiple fix attempts all failed:
  1. Template literal rewrite ‚Üí Failed
  2. String concatenation ‚Üí Failed
  3. HTML entities ‚Üí Worse
  4. Simplified prompt approach ‚Üí Still broken
- **Staff blocked from using PM flow** (urgent production issue)

**Resolution:**
- Emergency revert to commit **before all invoice features**
- Force pushed to production
- Triggered fresh Vercel deployment (bypassed cache)
- **System restored to working state** ‚úÖ

**Current Commit:** `2ba664b` (trigger deployment)
**Base Commit:** `03c0ae5` - "feat(prep): Add Prep Sheet tab with smart recommendations"

**Features Removed (Temporarily):**
- ‚ùå Invoice upload (PDF/image scanning)
- ‚ùå OCR text extraction (Tesseract.js)
- ‚ùå PDF.js library integration
- ‚ùå Auto-matching algorithm (fuzzy matching)
- ‚ùå Manual matching modal (all attempts)
- ‚ùå Invoice reconciliation UI
- ‚ùå Check-in functionality
- ‚ùå invoice_items database operations

**7 Commits Reverted:**
- f9c9b91: feat(invoice): Add manual item matching
- b990c02: fix(invoice): Fix template literal syntax
- 7b58308: fix(invoice): Rewrite with string concatenation
- 125dd29: fix(invoice): Use HTML entities
- 5c85d61: fix(invoice): Remove inline handlers
- 54f6086: fix(invoice): Simplify to prompt
- 442797d: feat(invoice): Base64 invoice upload + OCR

**Lesson Learned:**
- Avoid large HTML string generation in JavaScript
- Use DOM createElement() or hidden HTML templates instead
- Test complex features in isolation before deploying
- Vercel caching can hide deployment issues (check age header)

**Next Steps for Invoice System (Future):**
- Redesign modal using DOM-based approach
- Or use hidden HTML template in page
- Test thoroughly in isolation
- Consider feature branch workflow

### Features Currently Working (October 10, 2025):

#### **1. Mobile-Optimized Update Counts UI** ‚úÖ
- Completely rewrote stock counting interface for mobile-first design
- **Card-based layout** instead of desktop tables
- **Large touch targets:** 20px font, 14px padding for mobile keyboards
- **Status badges:** LOW (red), MEDIUM (orange), GOOD (green)
- **Relative timestamps:** "2h ago", "5d ago" instead of full dates
- **Mobile keyboard:** `inputmode="numeric"` triggers number pad
- **Responsive grid:** 300px min cards, auto-fills 2-3 columns on desktop
- **Commit:** `2a24937` - feat(ordering): Mobile-optimized Update Counts UI with card layout

#### **2. Dynamic Search and Vendor Filtering** ‚úÖ
- Added real-time search and vendor filtering to **both inventory tabs**
- **Search bar:** Filters by item name (case-insensitive, instant)
- **Vendor dropdown:** Filter by specific vendor or "All Vendors"
- **Combined filtering:** Search works within selected vendor
- **Applied to:**
  - Manage Inventory (master list with par levels)
  - Update Counts (mobile card layout)
- **Live item counts:** Headers show filtered counts per vendor
- **No results message:** Clear feedback when nothing matches
- **Commit:** `0419652` - feat(ordering): Add dynamic search and vendor filtering to inventory lists

#### **3. Auto-Save Stock Counts** ‚úÖ
- Stock counts now save **automatically** when you leave input field (on blur)
- **No "Save All" button needed** - saves instantly per item
- **Visual feedback:**
  - üü† Orange border + bg = Saving...
  - üü¢ Green flash = Saved! (800ms)
  - üî¥ Red flash = Error (1000ms)
- Input disabled during save to prevent conflicts
- Updates `current_stock` and `last_counted_date`
- Recalculates upcoming orders in background

#### **4. Vendor Management System** ‚úÖ
- **Move items between vendors:** Dropdown per item in Manage Inventory table
- **Rename vendors:** Bulk update all items with that vendor
- **"Manage Vendors" button:** Opens modal with all vendors + item counts
- **Delete protection:** Cannot delete vendors with items assigned
- **New functions:**
  - `getAllVendors()` - Get unique vendor list
  - `updateItemVendor()` - Change item's vendor
  - `renameVendor()` - Bulk rename vendor across all items
  - `showVendorManagement()` - Modal UI
- **Commit:** `df4ca57` - feat(ordering): Auto-save stock counts + vendor management

#### **5. AI Reasoning Display in Order Emails** ‚úÖ
- Added transparent calculation breakdown under each line item in automated order emails
- **Very small text:** 9px font, light gray (#bbb), italic styling - non-intrusive
- **Two display formats:**
  - **Simple (no historical data):** "AI: Par 2 - Stock 1 = 1 to order"
  - **Predictive:** "AI: 1.5/day √ó 2d = 3 + buffer 1 = 4 needed - 1 on hand"
- **Shows full algorithm logic:**
  - Average daily consumption rate
  - Days until next delivery (e.g., 2 days for Friday Greenleaf orders)
  - Base quantity calculation
  - Safety buffer from variability
  - Trend adjustments (if applicable)
  - Final calculation: predicted need - current stock
- **User request:** Make algorithm transparent without changing email table format
- **Commit:** `b197ae9` - feat(ordering): Add AI reasoning under each line item in order emails

**Note:** AI reasoning commit (b197ae9) was also reverted during emergency rollback, will need to be re-applied if desired.

## üöß Blockers & Issues
**Current Blockers:** None - system operational

## üîú Next Session Should Start With:
1. **Read last 3 RTF chat sessions** from `/chat sessions/` folder
   - Latest: `session_2025-10-10_invoice-manual-match-emergency-revert.rtf`
   - Previous: `session_2025-10-10_ai-reasoning-display.rtf`
   - Previous: `session_2025-10-10_mobile-ui-search-autosave-vendors.rtf`
2. **Ask user:** "What are we working on today?"
3. **Update CURRENT_STATUS.md** with session start time

### Important Context for Next Session:
- **Prep system is working** (37 prep items, count tracking, recommendations)
- **Ordering system is working** (basic version without recent mobile/search enhancements)
- **Invoice system was attempted but completely reverted**
- **Mobile UI improvements were also reverted** (collateral damage from emergency rollback)
- **User may want to re-apply working features** (mobile UI, search, auto-save, vendor management)

### Potential Next Actions:
**Option 1: Re-apply Working Features (Recommended)**
- Cherry-pick mobile UI commit (2a24937)
- Cherry-pick search/filter commit (0419652)
- Cherry-pick auto-save/vendor management commit (df4ca57)
- Cherry-pick AI reasoning commit (b197ae9)
- Test thoroughly before deploying

**Option 2: Retry Invoice System (Different Approach)**
- Use DOM createElement() instead of HTML strings
- Or use hidden HTML template approach
- Test in isolation first
- Consider feature branch workflow

**Option 3: New Features**
- Export inventory to CSV/Excel
- Historical stock tracking charts
- Low stock alerts dashboard
- Print-friendly order sheets
