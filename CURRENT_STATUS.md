## üöß Blockers & Issues
**Current Blockers:** None

### User Testing Required:
1. **COGs page display** - User reported layout jumping/hiding
   - Applied index.html pattern (dashboard visible, other sections hidden)
   - Needs hard refresh + user confirmation it's working

2. **Manual labor cost feature** - Ready for production use
   - User should test with Toast web total cost ($9,637.82)
   - Should see comparison in labor summary display

### Technical Notes:
- COGs database schema run successfully in Supabase
- 12 sample items created for testing
- RLS disabled on all COGs tables (app can access directly)
- Session management works across pages

---

## üîú Next Session Should Start With:
1. **Confirm COGs page is working** (dashboard visible, no jumping)
2. **Test item management** (add/edit/delete items)
3. **Begin COGs Day 2** - Invoice scanning implementation:
   - Add Tesseract.js CDN to cogs.html
   - Build camera capture UI
   - Implement OCR text extraction
   - Create invoice parser logic
   - Build review/edit form
   - Save to invoices + invoice_items tables

## üìä Production System Health
**Last Deployed:** 2025-10-09 (Multiple deploys - COGs Day 1 + labor fix)
**URL:** https://jayna-cash-counter.vercel.app
**Status:** ‚úÖ Operational

### Recent Deployments:
- COGs system foundation (LIVE - Day 1 complete)
- Manual labor cost input (LIVE)
- TDS auto-fetch optimization (LIVE)
- Database schema ready (SQL file ready to run)

---

## üîê Security Notes
**Environment Variables:** All configured (no changes needed)
**Secrets Status:** ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets in codebase
**Database:** All COGs tables have RLS disabled for app access

## üí° Key Implementation Details

### Manual Labor Cost Feature:
- **Input:** New field in tip pool form (optional)
- **Usage:** Enter Toast web "Total Cost" when needed
- **Calculation:** If provided, uses manual cost; otherwise uses API
- **Display:** Shows "(TOAST WEB)" or "(API)" label with comparison
- **Purpose:** Accounts for CA double-time (2x OT >12hrs/day) that API can't calculate

### COGs System Architecture:

**Database Tables:**
```
inventory_items       - Product master list
vendors              - Supplier information
invoices             - Scanned invoice metadata
invoice_items        - Line items from invoices
inventory_counts     - Daily/weekly snapshots
cogs_reports         - Generated analysis
usage_tracking       - Theoretical vs actual
count_schedules      - Count reminders
```

**Page Structure (cogs.html):**
```
Navigation (persistent)
‚Üì
Dashboard (active by default)
  - Quick Actions (4 buttons)
  - This Week Summary (placeholder)
‚Üì
Hidden Sections (display: none)
  - Manage Items
  - Scan Invoice (Day 2)
  - Daily Count (Day 3)
  - View Reports (Day 3)
  - Item Form
```

**Display Pattern (copied from index.html):**
- Dashboard: `class="active"` in HTML (visible on load)
- Other sections: `style="display: none"` inline
- No data loads on page load (only when user clicks)
- `showSection(id)` hides all, shows selected

### Labor Cost Discrepancy Analysis:
```
Toast Web:      $9,637.82
API Calculated: $9,494.68
Difference:     $143.14

Cause: CA double-time overtime (2x pay for >12hrs/day)
      Toast API only provides total overtimeHours
      Cannot separate 1.5x from 2x overtime

Examples:
Huseyin: 26.9 OT hrs @ avg 1.78x (mix of 1.5x and 2x)
Dilan:   16.4 OT hrs @ avg 1.56x (mostly 1.5x, some 2x)

Solution: Manual input field for accurate Toast web total
```
