Someone enters but hovers at the door looking confused\n\nFor each: What do you say? How loud? Do you stop what you're doing?\n\n### Reading the Room Introduction (30 min)\n\nPreview of deeper content in Module 3, but introduce concepts now.\n\n**Guest Energy Types:**\n- Excited/Celebratory: Match their energy, don't dampen it\n- Tired/Stressed: Calm, efficient, don't overwhelm\n- Confused/First-Time: Guide gently, no assumptions\n- Regulars: Recognition, familiarity, don't over-explain\n- In a Rush: Speed, accuracy, no unnecessary chat\n- On a Date: Give space, be attentive but not intrusive\n\n**The Skill:**\nReading body language, tone, pace—and adjusting your approach in real-time.\n\n\"You serve each guest differently because each guest IS different. The goal is the same—make them feel cared for—but the method changes.\"\n\n### Unreasonable Hospitality Concept (30 min)\n\nFrom the book \"Unreasonable Hospitality\" by Will Guidara—adapted for Jayna.\n\n**The Philosophy:**\n- Go beyond what's expected\n- Small gestures, massive impact\n- It doesn't have to cost money\n- It DOES require paying attention\n\n**Jayna Examples:**\n- Remembering a regular's name and order\n- Noticing someone struggling with pita and offering a fork without them asking\n- Complimenting a guest's outfit genuinely\n- Bringing extra napkins before they're needed\n- Free baklava for a birthday\n- Shot of ouzo for an engagement or celebration\n- Walking a guest's to-go order to their car in the rain\n\n**The Mindset:**\n\"What could I do right now that would make this person's day better?\"\n\nNot everything. Not every table. The RIGHT thing for the RIGHT person at the RIGHT moment.\n\n## Hands-On Activities\n\n### Activity 1: Five-Second Rule Practice (20 min)\n\nRole-play the greeting repeatedly.\n\nDemetri plays different guest types:\n- Confident walker\n- Hesitant, looking around\n- Distracted, on phone\n- Group of friends, loud\n- Solo, quiet\n\nHeming practices greeting each appropriately. Repeat until it feels natural, not scripted.\n\n### Activity 2: Floor Observation (30 min)\n\nDuring active service, Heming observes from a neutral position (not working, just watching).\n\n**Assignment:**\n- Watch 10 guest entries\n- Note: Were they greeted within 5 seconds? By whom?\n- Rate the greeting: 1-5 (energy, warmth, timing)\n- Identify 3 moments of great hospitality she witnessed\n- Identify 3 missed opportunities\n\n**Debrief:**\nDiscuss observations. What patterns emerged? What would she have done differently?\n\n### Activity 3: Unreasonable Hospitality Brainstorm (15 min)\n\nHeming brainstorms 10 potential \"unreasonable hospitality\" moments she could create:\n- Low/no cost\n- Personalized\n- Memorable\n\nShare and discuss. Which are practical? Which would Demetri want to see?\n\n## Trainer Notes\n\n**Tone for This Unit:**\nInspirational but grounded. This is the soul of Jayna—Heming should feel moved by it, not just informed. Get passionate. Tell stories. Make it real.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Reading the SOP like a policy document instead of a philosophy\n- Skipping the practice (Five-Second Rule must be practiced, not just explained)\n- Not connecting it to your personal story\n- Making it feel optional (\"nice to have\") rather than essential\n\n**The Test:**\nIf Heming can't explain why hospitality matters at Jayna—in her own words, with conviction—this unit isn't complete.\n\n**End This Unit With:**\n\"Everything you learn from here forward—opening checklists, cocktail recipes, HR paperwork—all of it serves this philosophy. If you ever wonder why we do something, the answer usually connects back to what we talked about today. Questions?\"\n\n---\n",
