Frozen yogurt\n\n**While Tasting:**\n- Note flavors, textures, what stands out\n- Think about how you'd describe this to a guest\n- Ask BOH questions about preparation\n- Consider: what would you recommend this to?\n\n### Building Menu Enthusiasm (30 min)\n\nSelling food isn't reciting ingredients—it's transferring enthusiasm.\n\n**Practice Descriptions:**\n\nInstead of: \"That's beef and lamb gyro meat with vegetables and sauce.\"\n\nTry: \"Our beef and lamb gyro is our signature—it's a perfect blend of seasoned meat, shaved to order right off the vertical spit. The meat is crispy on the edges, tender in the middle. With our housemade tzatziki and fresh vegetables in warm pita? It's the dish that made us famous.\"\n\n**For Each Core Item:**\n- One sentence description (quick)\n- Enthusiastic description (when guest wants more)\n- Personal recommendation (\"I love it with extra spicy aioli\")\n\n**Common Guest Questions:**\n- \"What's good here?\" → Have an answer ready\n- \"What's your favorite?\" → Be genuine, be specific\n- \"What do you recommend for [dietary need]?\" → Know the options\n- \"Is this spicy?\" → Know the heat levels\n- \"What's the portion size?\" → Be able to describe accurately\n\n## Hands-On Activities\n\n### Activity 1: Menu Tasting Log\n\nWhile tasting, Heming completes a log:\n\n| Item | Flavor Notes | Texture | Would Recommend To | My Enthusiasm Pitch |\n|------|--------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Beef Gyro | | | | |\n| etc. | | | | |\n\n### Activity 2: Allergen Quiz\n\nRapid-fire allergen questions:\n\n1. Guest has celiac disease. What can they eat?\n2. Guest is allergic to sesame. What should they avoid?\n3. Guest is vegan. What are their options?\n4. Guest can't have dairy. Can they have tzatziki? What's the alternative?\n5. Guest has a tree nut allergy. Is baklava safe?\n\n### Activity 3: Selling the Menu Role-Play\n\nDemetri plays different guests:\n1. \"What's good here? It's my first time.\"\n2. \"I want something healthy but filling.\"\n3. \"My kid is picky—what would they like?\"\n4. \"I'm vegetarian. What are my options?\"\n5. \"I want the most authentic Greek thing you have.\"\n\nHeming recommends and describes with enthusiasm.\n\n## Trainer Notes\n\n**Tone for This Unit:**\nDelicious and proud. Heming should leave hungry and excited to share this food with guests. Make her FEEL the quality.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Skipping the tasting (\"she can try things on her own time\")\n- Just listing ingredients without stories\n- Not practicing enthusiastic descriptions\n- Glossing over allergens (this is safety-critical)\n\n**The Test:**\nA guest asks \"What should I get?\" Heming should have an immediate, enthusiastic, personalized recommendation ready.\n\n**End This Unit With:**\n\"You've now tasted what you're selling. You know the stories, the allergens, the modifications. When you talk about our food, it's not from a menu—it's from experience. That authenticity? Guests feel it.\"\n\n---\n\n# MODULE 1 COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT\n\n## Practical Demonstrations\n\n### Demonstration 1: Restaurant Tour (10 min)\nHeming gives Demetri a 3-minute \"tour\" of Jayna as if Demetri is a first-time guest asking \"Tell me about this place.\"\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n- [ ] Mentions Yusuf's vision and the mission\n- [ ] Explains \"fine-casual\" concept\n- [ ] Shows enthusiasm and ownership\n- [ ] Hits key areas without rambling\n- [ ] Would make a guest excited to be there\n\n### Demonstration 2: Five-Second Rule Live (15 min)\nDuring service, Heming is responsible for greeting the next 5 guests who enter.\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n- [ ] Each guest greeted within 5 seconds\n- [ ] Eye contact made\n- [ ] Greeting is warm, audible, appropriate to guest energy\n- [ ] Heming doesn't wait for someone else to greet\n- [ ] Natural, not robotic\n\n### Demonstration 3: Menu Knowledge Rapid-Fire (10 min)\nDemetri asks 10 rapid-fire questions.\n\nSample questions:\n1.
