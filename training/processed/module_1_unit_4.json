As an Assistant Manager, she'll bridge FOH and BOH constantly. Building relationships with kitchen staff now prevents the \"us vs. them\" dynamic that kills restaurants.\n\n## Content to Cover\n\n### BOH Organizational Structure (15 min)\n\n**Positions:**\n- Kitchen Manager / Order Manager: Inventory, ordering, systems, leadership\n- Lead Prep Cook: Recipe prep specialist, training, quality control\n- Line Cook: Service execution, station management, plating\n- Prep Cook / Dishwasher / Cleaner: Prep support, sanitation, dish pit\n\n**The Trilingual Reality:**\n- Our BOH team includes English, Spanish, and Turkish speakers\n- Respect means meeting people where they are\n- Key phrases to learn (optional but impressive)\n- Translation resources when needed\n\n**How BOH Works:**\n- Prep happens before service (mise en place)\n- Line operates during service\n- Dish keeps everything moving\n- Everyone cleans—it's not just one person's job\n\n### Individual Introductions (45-60 min)\n\nSame approach as FOH—personal, respectful, genuine.\n\n**For Each Person:**\n- Name, role, languages spoken\n- How long at Jayna\n- One thing they do well\n- Something Demetri respects about them\n\n**Special Attention:**\n- Kitchen Manager: This is a key relationship for ordering, inventory, communication\n- Lead Prep: Partner for training, quality standards\n- Senior Line Cooks: Respect their experience\n\n**Cultural Sensitivity:**\n- Some team members may be quieter in introductions\n- Respect different communication styles\n- A smile and respectful demeanor transcend language\n\n### Kitchen Observation (45-60 min)\n\nHeming observes each BOH station during active work.\n\n**Prep Area Observation:**\n- Watch recipe preparation\n- See the scale and precision required\n- Notice the organization system\n- Understand what \"mise en place\" means in practice\n\n**Line Observation:**\n- Watch orders come in and get executed\n- See the gyro shaving technique\n- Notice the pace during a rush\n- Observe communication (tickets called, responses)\n\n**Dish Pit Observation:**\n- Understand the volume and pace\n- See how clean dishes get staged\n- Notice the role in keeping FOH stocked\n- Appreciate the physical demands\n\n**Follow an Order:**\nWatch a single order from:\n- Ticket printing\n- Items being prepared at each station\n- Plating and quality check\n- Handoff to expo\n- Delivery to guest\n\nThis is the full picture of what BOH does for every single order.\n\n## Hands-On Activities\n\n### Activity 1: BOH Team Roster (Ongoing)\n\nSame as FOH:\n- Every BOH team member's name\n- Their role and languages spoken\n- One personal detail\n- One professional strength\n\n### Activity 2: Order Flow Diagram (After observation)\n\nHeming draws or describes the journey of an order:\n- Where does it start?\n- What stations does it touch?\n- Where are the handoffs?\n- Where could things go wrong?\n\nThis builds her understanding of the system.\n\n### Activity 3: Communication Bridge Practice (Optional)\n\nIf comfortable, Heming practices basic communication:\n- Thanking a line cook for a plate (in Spanish or Turkish if she wants to try)\n- Asking \"How can I help?\" during a rush\n- Acknowledging good work specifically\n\n## Trainer Notes\n\n**Tone for This Unit:**\nHumble and respectful. BOH often feels underappreciated. Heming should enter their space as a learner, not a manager.\n\n**Common Pitfalls:**\n- Treating BOH tour as less important than FOH\n- Not introducing Heming properly to kitchen team\n- Skipping dish pit (\"it's just dishes\")\n- Not explaining the trilingual dynamic\n\n**Critical Point:**\n\"As Assistant Manager, you will never succeed if BOH doesn't respect you. Respect is earned by knowing what they do, appreciating how hard it is, and never asking them to do something you wouldn't do yourself.\"\n\n**End This Unit With:**\n\"Now you've met the whole Jayna family. FOH and BOH are one team—we succeed or fail together. Your job is to make that connection stronger, not create division.\"\n\n---\n",
