    "fullMarkdown": "# UNIT 1.1: WELCOME & ORIENTATION\n\n**Duration:** 3-4 hours  \n**Trainer:** Demetri  \n**Location:** Office → Full restaurant tour\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis is Heming's first real impression of Jayna beyond the interview. Set the tone that this is not just a job—it's joining a family with deep roots and high standards. Make her feel chosen, not just hired.\n\n## Content to Cover\n\n### Opening Conversation (30-45 min, office)\n\nStart in the office, door closed, no interruptions. This is personal.\n\n**Why Heming Was Selected:**\n- Acknowledge her lack of restaurant experience directly: \"You don't have restaurant experience, and that's actually why you're here. We can teach systems to anyone. We can't teach character, work ethic, and genuine care for people. You have those.\"\n- Share what stood out about her in the interview/hiring process\n- Be specific about the qualities you saw\n\n**What Success Looks Like in This Role:**\n- \"In 30 days, you'll be able to run this restaurant when I'm not here.\"\n- \"In 90 days, I should be able to take a week off and know everything is handled.\"\n- \"Your job isn't to be me—it's to be the best version of yourself in service of our team and guests.\"\n\n**The Relationship We're Building:**\n- \"I need you to tell me when something's wrong, even if it's something I did.\"\n- \"I'll never put you in a position to fail without support.\"\n- \"Questions aren't weakness—they're how we get better.\"\n\n### Jayna's Origin Story (30 min)\n\nTell the story. Don't just recite facts—make it come alive.\n\n**Yusuf Topal's Journey:**\n- Born in Turkey, raised in the culinary traditions of the Aegean region\n- Fell in love with California's local ingredients and food culture\n- Opened Jayna Gyro to bridge two worlds: Mediterranean soul, California freshness\n- His obsession: doing things the RIGHT way, never cutting corners\n- The name \"Jayna\" and its meaning to him\n\n**The Sacramento Mission:**\n- Why Sacramento specifically\n- The community we serve\n- How we fit into the local food scene\n- Our reputation and what we're building toward\n\n### Demetri's Story (30 min)\n\nThis is your chance to connect personally. Be vulnerable. Share the real story.\n\n**Your Greek Roots:**\n- First-generation Greek-American\n- Growing up between Sacramento and Alonissos\n- Your father's homeland and what it taught you about hospitality\n- The summers working in the cliffside restaurant\n- What you were searching for in Greece and what you found\n\n**Hospitality as Salvation:**\n- How the restaurant industry gave you career, family, purpose\n- The failures and successes that shaped you\n- Why you came back after leaving\n- What this restaurant means to you personally\n\n**Your Leadership Philosophy:**\n- \"I don't expect perfection—I expect effort and honesty.\"\n- \"We protect each other. We don't throw each other under the bus.\"\n- \"The standards exist because they work, not because I enjoy making rules.\"\n\n### The Meaning of \"Fine-Casual\" (15 min)\n\nThis is our competitive advantage. Make sure Heming understands it deeply.\n\n**What It Means:**\n- Counter service efficiency with full-service hospitality\n- Fast food speed with fine dining quality\n- Accessible prices with elevated experience\n- The guest orders at the counter but feels cared for throughout their entire visit\n\n**What It Looks Like in Practice:**\n- We check on tables like a full-service restaurant\n- We clear and manicure tables throughout service\n- We deliver food hot and beautifully plated—not dropped\n- We know our menu, our wines, our cocktails—and we're proud of them\n- We do refills, small touches, human moments that surprise people\n\n**Why It Works:**\n- Guests get the convenience they want AND the experience they crave\n- We operate efficiently while creating memorable moments\n- This positions us above fast-casual chains but more accessible than fine dining\n\n### The Restaurant Tour (45-60 min)\n\nThis isn't a quick walkthrough—it's an immersive experience. Move slowly. Tell stories at each stop.\n\n**Front of House Tour:**\nWalk the path a guest walks.\n\n*Parking Lot / Exterior:*\n- \"This is where first impressions start. Look at it through a guest's eyes.\"\n- Point out signage, cleanliness standards, what we maintain\n- \"Employees park [where]. Guests always get the best spots.\"\n\n*Entry / Host Area:*\n- \"Within 5 seconds of entering, every guest should be acknowledged.\"\n- Explain the kiosk, the flow, where people tend to congregate\n- \"The goal is to cancel awkwardness immediately.\"\n\n*Ordering Counter:*\n- Walk through the ordering experience\n- Point out the menu boards, the flow of the line\n- \"This is where we start building the relationship.\"\n\n*Dining Room:*\n- \"Salt to the street\" table setup\n- Explain the lighting, the vibe we create\n- Point out the details guests notice (and the ones they don't consciously see but feel)\n\n*Bar Area:*\n- \"We don't just serve drinks—we serve stories.\"\n- Brief overview of the bar program (deep dive comes in Module 4)\n- Point out the craft and intention behind the setup\n\n*Patio:*\n- Seasonal considerations\n- What makes outdoor dining special at Jayna\n\n*Bathrooms (Sword and Medusa):*\n- \"A dirty bathroom tells guests everything about what's happening in the kitchen.\"\n- Walk through what \"clean\" really means here\n- These are named—they have personality\n\n*Water Station / Self-Service:*\n- The \"abundant spa vibe\" concept\n- Why cucumber and lemon, why overflowing ice\n- \"This should look luxurious and inviting.\"\n\n**Back of House Tour:**\n\n*Kitchen Line:*\n- Each station and what happens there\n- The flow of an order from ticket to plate\n- Introduce her to whoever is working (brief, don't interrupt service)\n\n*Prep Area:*\n- Where the magic happens before service\n- The importance of mise en place\n\n*Walk-in Coolers:*\n- Organization system\n- FIFO principles (introduce concept, deeper training later)\n\n*Dry Storage / Container:*\n- How we organize supplies\n- \"No unopened boxes on the floor\"\n\n*Dish Pit:*\n- The unsung heroes\n- How FOH and dish work together\n\n*Office:*\n- Where she'll spend time on admin\n- Safe location (don't share code yet—that comes with cash training)\n\n**Tour Closing:**\nWalk back to the dining room together.\n\n\"This whole space is yours to protect and improve. In a few weeks, you'll know every corner better than you know your own home.\"\n\n## Hands-On Activities\n\n### Activity 1: Walk the Guest Journey (15 min)\n\nHeming walks through the restaurant alone, as if she's a first-time guest:\n- Park in the lot\n- Walk to the entrance\n- Enter and wait to be acknowledged\n- Look at the menu\n- Find a seat\n- Look around the dining room\n- Use the bathroom\n- Exit\n\n**Debrief Questions:**\n- What did you notice that you liked?\n- What felt awkward or unclear?\n- What would a first-time guest need help with?\n\n### Activity 2: Find Five Things Guests See That Staff Overlook (15 min)\n\nArmed with fresh eyes, Heming identifies 5 details that could impact guest experience—things staff might miss because they're \"blind\" to them.\n\nExamples might include:\n- A smudge on a menu\n- A chair slightly out of alignment\n- Dust on a light fixture\n- An empty soap dispenser\n- A cluttered corner\n\n**Debrief:**\nDiscuss each finding. Some might be valid issues; some might be intentional choices. Either way, it trains observation.\n\n## Trainer Notes\n\n**Tone for This Unit:**\nWarm, welcoming, personal. This isn't orientation day at a corporate job—this is initiation into a family. Heming should leave this unit feeling:\n- Honored to be chosen\n- Connected to the story and mission\n- Aware of the standards (without feeling intimidated)\n- Excited to learn more\n\n**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**\n- Rushing through the tour because you've done it 100 times\n- Being interrupted by operational issues (delegate or delay them)\n- Forgetting to ask Heming questions and listen to her perspective\n- Making it feel like a lecture instead of a conversation\n\n**End This Unit With:**\n\"Tomorrow we'll handle the boring but important stuff—paperwork, policies, getting you set up officially. But I wanted your first day to be about who we are, not what forms we need. Any questions before we wrap?\"\n\n---\n",
