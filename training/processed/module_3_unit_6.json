    "fullMarkdown": "# UNIT 3.6: DIFFICULT SITUATIONS BEYOND COMPLAINTS\n\n**Duration:** 3-4 hours  \n**Trainer:** Demetri  \n**Location:** Office + floor role-play\n\n## Purpose\n\nSome situations go beyond simple complaints. This unit prepares Heming for scenarios that require judgment, tact, and sometimes escalation.\n\n## Content to Cover\n\n### Intoxicated Guests (30 min)\n\n**Recognition Signs:**\n- Slurred speech\n- Unsteady walking\n- Loud, boisterous behavior beyond normal\n- Glassy eyes\n- Ordering drinks rapidly\n- Becoming argumentative\n\n**The Approach:**\n\n**Slow Service:**\n- Delay drink delivery\n- Offer food: \"Can I get you some fries with that?\"\n- Bring water without asking\n- Stretch time between rounds\n\n**The Cut-Off:**\nIf needed, be firm but kind:\n- \"I think we've had a great time tonight—let me close this tab out for you\"\n- \"I'm going to switch you to water for now—safety first\"\n- Never use the word \"drunk\"\n\n**When to Get Help:**\n- If they become aggressive\n- If they insist on driving\n- If you feel unsafe\n\n**Manager Role:**\nManagers handle confrontational cut-offs. Heming should get Demetri if guest pushes back.\n\n### Disruptive Guests (20 min)\n\n**Types:**\n- Loud complainers disturbing others\n- Arguments between guests\n- Inappropriate behavior\n- Harassment of staff\n\n**De-escalation:**\n- Stay calm, speak quietly (they often match your volume)\n- Acknowledge their frustration\n- Move them away from other guests if possible\n- Offer solution, not argument\n\n**When to Escalate:**\n- Any threat of violence\n- Harassment doesn't stop\n- Other guests are affected\n- Your safety feels threatened\n\n### Guest Injuries (20 min)\n\n**Immediate Response:**\n1. Ensure guest safety (don't move them if serious)\n2. Get Demetri immediately\n3. Offer first aid if minor (band-aids, ice)\n4. Never admit liability (\"I'm so sorry this happened\" ≠ \"It's our fault\")\n\n**Documentation:**\n- Incident report completed SAME DAY\n- What happened, when, where, who witnessed\n- Guest contact information\n- Photos if relevant\n\n**Incident Report Form:**\nReview the blank incident report form. Practice completing one for a hypothetical scenario.\n\n### Payment Issues (15 min)\n\n**Card Declined:**\n- Quietly: \"This card isn't going through—do you have another one we can try?\"\n- Never announce loudly\n- Offer to try again or use different card\n- If no payment possible: Get Demetri\n\n**Walkouts:**\n- If you see someone leaving without paying: Don't chase into parking lot\n- Note description, inform manager immediately\n- Check cameras\n- Document\n\n**Disputes:**\n- \"I didn't order that\" → Check ticket, apologize, remove if genuinely wrong\n- \"I was charged wrong\" → Review receipt together, correct if error\n- Major disputes → Get Demetri\n\n### \"I Want to Speak to a Manager\" (15 min)\n\n**Not Always Bad:**\nSometimes they want to compliment. Sometimes they have a request only a manager can handle.\n\n**When to Handle Yourself:**\n- Complaint you can fix\n- Question you can answer\n- Issue within your authority\n\n**When to Get Demetri:**\n- They specifically request manager\n- Issue is beyond your authority\n- You've tried and they're still upset\n- Any legal/liability concern\n\n**The Handoff:**\n\"Absolutely, let me get Demetri for you. She'll take great care of you.\"\nBrief Demetri before they arrive at the table.\n\n### Online Review Mentions (15 min)\n\nWhen a guest says: \"I'm going to leave a bad review\"\n\n**Don't:**\n- Panic\n- Get defensive\n- Make promises you can't keep\n- Match their hostility\n\n**Do:**\n- \"I'm really sorry we've let you down. Can you tell me what happened so I can try to make it right?\"\n- Escalate to Demetri\n- Document what happened\n- Try to resolve before they leave\n\n**The Goal:**\nTurn the experience around so they have no reason to leave a bad review—or update it later.\n\n## Hands-On Activities\n\n### Activity 1: Scenario Role-Play (45 min)\n\nPractice each difficult situation:\n\n1. **Intoxicated guest wants another drink**\n2. **Table is being very loud, bothering other guests**\n3. **Guest says they slipped on a wet floor**\n4. **Card declined, guest is embarrassed**\n5. **Guest says \"I want to speak to your manager\" (angry)**\n6. **Guest says \"I'm leaving a one-star review right now\"**\n\nFor each: Practice response, then debrief.\n\n### Activity 2: Incident Report Practice (15 min)\n\nComplete an incident report for this scenario:\n\n\"A guest tripped over a chair leg while walking to the bathroom. They fell and scraped their knee. Another guest helped them up. The injured guest says they're fine but seems shaken.\"\n\nComplete the form. Review with Demetri.\n\n### Activity 3: Cut-Off Script Practice (15 min)\n\nPractice the intoxication cut-off conversation:\n- The soft approach (slowing service)\n- The firm approach (closing their tab)\n- Handling pushback\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\n1. Signs of intoxication include...\n2. If a guest's card is declined, I will...\n3. If a guest says \"I'm going to leave a bad review,\" I should...\n4. I should immediately get Demetri when...\n5. An incident report should include...\n\n---\n\n# MODULE 3 COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT\n\n## Practical Demonstrations\n\n### Demonstration 1: \"Problem Guest\" Role-Play (15 min)\n\nDemetri poses as 5 different problem scenarios (rapid-fire):\n1.
