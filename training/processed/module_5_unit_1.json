If something goes wrong, I fix it or escalate it. If something goes right, I recognize it.\"\n\n### Setting the Tone (20 min)\n\n**Your Energy Becomes the Team's Energy:**\n- Walk in stressed → team feels stressed\n- Walk in positive → team feeds off it\n- Walk in checked out → team checks out\n\n**How to Set Positive Tone:**\n- Greet every team member by name when you arrive\n- Brief check-in: \"How's your day going?\"\n- Address concerns quickly (don't let negativity fester)\n- Model the behavior you expect\n- Stay visible—don't hide in the office\n\n**During Stressful Moments:**\n- Stay calm externally (even if stressed internally)\n- Clear communication: \"Here's what we're doing\"\n- Thank people in the moment: \"Great hustle on that rush\"\n\n### The Pre-Shift Meeting (45 min)\n\n**Purpose:**\n- Alignment: Everyone knows what's happening today\n- Information: Specials, 86s, VIPs, goals\n- Motivation: Start the shift on a high note\n- Connection: Team feels unified\n\n**Structure (5-10 minutes max):**\n\n1. **Quick Wins / Recognition (1-2 min)**\n   - Shout out great work from recent shifts\n   - Celebrate birthdays, milestones\n   - Start positive\n\n2. **Sales Goal / Focus (1 min)**\n   - What's our target today?\n   - What are we pushing? (feature cocktail, dessert, wine)\n   - Keep it simple, specific\n\n3. **Operational Updates (2-3 min)**\n   - 86'd items\n   - Specials\n   - VIPs or reservations\n   - Any equipment issues\n   - Staffing notes (who's coming in late, etc.)\n\n4. **Focus Area (1-2 min)**\n   - One thing to emphasize today\n   - Examples: \"Five-Second Rule,\" \"Table touches,\" \"Upselling dessert\"\n   - Why it matters\n\n5. **Team Hands-In (30 sec)**\n   - End with energy\n   - \"Let's have a great shift—hands in!\"\n   - Quick break, everyone disperses\n\n**What NOT to Do:**\n- Ramble beyond 10 minutes\n- Only share negatives\n- Skip it because you're \"too busy\"\n- Read from notes robotically\n\n### Delegation That Works (30 min)\n\n**The Components of Clear Delegation:**\n\n1. **Clear Task**\n   - What exactly needs to be done?\n   - \"Stock the to-go station\" not \"make sure we're stocked\"\n\n2. **Expected Outcome**\n   - What does success look like?\n   - \"100% full, neat, nothing expired\"\n\n3. **Timeline**\n   - By when?\n   - \"Before the dinner rush\" or \"in the next 30 minutes\"\n\n4. **Check for Understanding**\n   - \"Does that make sense?\"\n   - \"Any questions?\"\n\n5. **Follow-Up**\n   - Actually check that it got done\n   - Acknowledge completion: \"Thanks—looks great\"\n\n**Example:**\n❌ \"Can you take care of the bathrooms?\"\n✅ \"Can you do a full bathroom reset—check supplies, wipe everything down, make sure it's guest-ready—in the next 20 minutes? Let me know when it's done.\"\n\n**Common Delegation Mistakes:**\n- Assuming they know what you mean\n- Not following up (they think you don't care)\n- Doing it yourself because \"it's faster\"\n- Delegating without authority (then micromanaging)\n\n### Situational Awareness (20 min)\n\n**Eyes Everywhere:**\nAs MOD, you're not focused on one task—you're scanning constantly.\n\n**What to Monitor:**\n- Guest experience: Are people being greeted? Happy? Waiting?\n- Team: Is anyone struggling? Overwhelmed? Checked out?\n- Kitchen: Tickets backing up? Communication flowing?\n- Bar: Backed up? Running low?\n- Cleanliness: Anything a guest would notice?\n\n**The 5-Minute Sweep:**\nEvery 5-10 minutes, do a quick mental check:\n- Guests: All good?\n- Team: All good?\n- Kitchen: All good?\n- Bar: All good?\n- Anything I need to address?\n\n### Decision-Making Framework (15 min)\n\nWhen facing a decision you're unsure about:\n\n**Step 1: Ask \"What would Demetri do?\"**\nIf you know, do it.\n\n**Step 2: Ask \"What serves the guest and team?\"**\nUsually the right answer is clear.\n\n**Step 3: Ask \"Can I explain this decision?\"**\nIf you can clearly explain your reasoning, you're probably right.\n\n**Step 4: If still unsure, ask.**\nText Demetri. Call. No shame in checking.\n\n**The Bias:**\nWhen in doubt, err on the side of:\n- Taking care of the guest\n- Supporting the team\n- Protecting standards\n\n## Hands-On Activities\n\n### Activity 1: Observe Pre-Shift Meetings (2-3 shifts)\n\nWatch Demetri run pre-shift meetings:\n- Note the structure\n- Note the energy\n- Note team response\n\n### Activity 2: Write a Pre-Shift Meeting Outline\n\nCreate an outline for tomorrow's pre-shift:\n- Recognition\n- Sales goal\n- Updates\n- Focus area\n- Closing\n\n### Activity 3: Deliver a Practice Pre-Shift\n\nDeliver the meeting to Demetri (role-playing as the team):\n- Get feedback\n- Adjust and try again\n\n## Reflection Questions\n\n1.
