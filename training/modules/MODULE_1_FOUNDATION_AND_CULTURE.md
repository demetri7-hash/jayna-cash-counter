# MODULE 1: FOUNDATION & CULTURE
## "Before you learn WHAT to do, you must understand WHO we are."

**Trainee:** Heming Huang, Assistant Manager  
**Primary Trainer:** Demetri Gregorakis, General Manager  
**Estimated Duration:** 20-24 hours across 6 training units

---

## MODULE OVERVIEW

This module establishes the foundation for everything that follows. Before Heming learns operational procedures, cocktail recipes, or management techniques, she must internalize Jayna's identity, culture, and hospitality philosophy. Every decision she makes as Assistant Manager should be filtered through "What would serve our guests and honor our values?"

### Why This Module Matters

Heming has zero restaurant experience. This is actually an advantage—she has no bad habits to unlearn, no "that's how we did it at my last place" baggage. But it means we must build her understanding from the ground up. This module creates the mental framework that makes all other training stick.

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

By the end of Module 1, Heming can:

- [ ] Articulate Jayna's mission and hospitality philosophy without reading from a document
- [ ] Explain the meaning of "the gyro is the vehicle, hospitality is the destination"
- [ ] Describe Yusuf's background and vision for the restaurant
- [ ] Describe Demetri's leadership philosophy and Greek hospitality roots
- [ ] Name every current team member, their role, and one personal detail about them
- [ ] Navigate the entire restaurant (FOH, BOH, storage, office) confidently
- [ ] Complete all HR onboarding paperwork accurately
- [ ] Demonstrate understanding of the Employee Handbook's key policies
- [ ] Describe at least 10 menu items with enthusiasm and accuracy
- [ ] Identify all major allergens across the menu

# UNIT 1.1: WELCOME & ORIENTATION

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Office → Full restaurant tour

## Purpose

This is Heming's first real impression of Jayna beyond the interview. Set the tone that this is not just a job—it's joining a family with deep roots and high standards. Make her feel chosen, not just hired.

## Content to Cover

### Opening Conversation (30-45 min, office)

Start in the office, door closed, no interruptions. This is personal.

**Why Heming Was Selected:**
- Acknowledge her lack of restaurant experience directly: "You don't have restaurant experience, and that's actually why you're here. We can teach systems to anyone. We can't teach character, work ethic, and genuine care for people. You have those."
- Share what stood out about her in the interview/hiring process
- Be specific about the qualities you saw

**What Success Looks Like in This Role:**
- "In 30 days, you'll be able to run this restaurant when I'm not here."
- "In 90 days, I should be able to take a week off and know everything is handled."
- "Your job isn't to be me—it's to be the best version of yourself in service of our team and guests."

**The Relationship We're Building:**
- "I need you to tell me when something's wrong, even if it's something I did."
- "I'll never put you in a position to fail without support."
- "Questions aren't weakness—they're how we get better."

### Jayna's Origin Story (30 min)

Tell the story. Don't just recite facts—make it come alive.

**Yusuf Topal's Journey:**
- Born in Turkey, raised in the culinary traditions of the Aegean region
- Fell in love with California's local ingredients and food culture
- Opened Jayna Gyro to bridge two worlds: Mediterranean soul, California freshness
- His obsession: doing things the RIGHT way, never cutting corners
- The name "Jayna" and its meaning to him

**The Sacramento Mission:**
- Why Sacramento specifically
- The community we serve
- How we fit into the local food scene
- Our reputation and what we're building toward

### Demetri's Story (30 min)

This is your chance to connect personally. Be vulnerable. Share the real story.

**Your Greek Roots:**
- First-generation Greek-American
- Growing up between Sacramento and Alonissos
- Your father's homeland and what it taught you about hospitality
- The summers working in the cliffside restaurant
- What you were searching for in Greece and what you found

**Hospitality as Salvation:**
- How the restaurant industry gave you career, family, purpose
- The failures and successes that shaped you
- Why you came back after leaving
- What this restaurant means to you personally

**Your Leadership Philosophy:**
- "I don't expect perfection—I expect effort and honesty."
- "We protect each other. We don't throw each other under the bus."
- "The standards exist because they work, not because I enjoy making rules."

### The Meaning of "Fine-Casual" (15 min)

This is our competitive advantage. Make sure Heming understands it deeply.

**What It Means:**
- Counter service efficiency with full-service hospitality
- Fast food speed with fine dining quality
- Accessible prices with elevated experience
- The guest orders at the counter but feels cared for throughout their entire visit

**What It Looks Like in Practice:**
- We check on tables like a full-service restaurant
- We clear and manicure tables throughout service
- We deliver food hot and beautifully plated—not dropped
- We know our menu, our wines, our cocktails—and we're proud of them
- We do refills, small touches, human moments that surprise people

**Why It Works:**
- Guests get the convenience they want AND the experience they crave
- We operate efficiently while creating memorable moments
- This positions us above fast-casual chains but more accessible than fine dining

### The Restaurant Tour (45-60 min)

This isn't a quick walkthrough—it's an immersive experience. Move slowly. Tell stories at each stop.

- Walk through what "clean" really means here
- These are named—they have personality

*Water Station / Self-Service:*
- The "abundant spa vibe" concept
- Why cucumber and lemon, why overflowing ice
- "This should look luxurious and inviting."

**Back of House Tour:**

*Kitchen Line:*
- Each station and what happens there
- The flow of an order from ticket to plate
- Introduce her to whoever is working (brief, don't interrupt service)

*Prep Area:*
- Where the magic happens before service
- The importance of mise en place

*Walk-in Coolers:*
- Organization system
- FIFO principles (introduce concept, deeper training later)

*Dry Storage / Container:*
- How we organize supplies
- "No unopened boxes on the floor"

*Dish Pit:*

**Tour Closing:**
Walk back to the dining room together.

"This whole space is yours to protect and improve. In a few weeks, you'll know every corner better than you know your own home."

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Walk the Guest Journey (15 min)

Heming walks through the restaurant alone, as if she's a first-time guest:
- Park in the lot
- Walk to the entrance
- Enter and wait to be acknowledged
- Look at the menu
- Find a seat
- Look around the dining room
- Use the bathroom
- Exit

**Debrief Questions:**
- What did you notice that you liked?
- What felt awkward or unclear?
- What would a first-time guest need help with?

### Activity 2: Find Five Things Guests See That Staff Overlook (15 min)

Armed with fresh eyes, Heming identifies 5 details that could impact guest experience—things staff might miss because they're "blind" to them.

Examples might include:
- A smudge on a menu
- A chair slightly out of alignment
- Dust on a light fixture
- An empty soap dispenser
- A cluttered corner

**Debrief:**
Discuss each finding. Some might be valid issues; some might be intentional choices. Either way, it trains observation.

## Trainer Notes

**Tone for This Unit:**
Warm, welcoming, personal. This isn't orientation day at a corporate job—this is initiation into a family. Heming should leave this unit feeling:
- Honored to be chosen
- Connected to the story and mission
- Aware of the standards (without feeling intimidated)
- Excited to learn more

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Rushing through the tour because you've done it 100 times
- Being interrupted by operational issues (delegate or delay them)
- Forgetting to ask Heming questions and listen to her perspective
- Making it feel like a lecture instead of a conversation

**End This Unit With:**
"Tomorrow we'll handle the boring but important stuff—paperwork, policies, getting you set up officially. But I wanted your first day to be about who we are, not what forms we need. Any questions before we wrap?"

---

# UNIT 1.2: HR ONBOARDING & COMPLIANCE

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Office

## Purpose

Complete all required employment paperwork and ensure Heming understands key policies. This is administrative but important—done well, it protects both Heming and Jayna. Done poorly, it creates liability and confusion.

## Content to Cover

- Can be revoked anytime in writing

**Handbook Acknowledgment:**
- She's signing that she received and will read the handbook
- Not signing that she memorizes every word
- Key sections will be reviewed together (next section)

### Employee Handbook Review (45-60 min)

Don't read the whole handbook aloud—focus on the sections that matter most for a new Assistant Manager.

**At-Will Employment (Critical):**
- "This means either you or Jayna can end employment at any time, for any legal reason or no reason."
- "It doesn't mean we fire people casually—it means we don't have contracts that lock either party in."

### Homebase Setup (15-20 min)

Get her into the communication system immediately.

**Account Creation:**
- Create her Homebase profile
- Set up the app on her phone
- Add her to appropriate groups

**Expectations for Communication:**
- Check Homebase at least [X times per day]
- Respond to messages within [X hours]
- How to request time off
- How to swap shifts (once she's on the schedule)

**Practice:**
- Send her a test message
- Have her respond
- Show her where to find the schedule

### Schedule Discussion (15 min)

Set expectations for her schedule during training and beyond.

**Training Period:**
- Flexible to accommodate training needs
- Mixture of shifts to see all dayparts
- Goal is exposure to everything, not just one shift type

**Post-Training:**
- Expected hours per week
- Typical shifts for Assistant Manager
- Weekend/holiday expectations
- How scheduling will work with Demetri

**Availability:**
- Get her general availability
- Discuss any constraints (school, family, other commitments)

### Activity 2: Policy Scenarios (15 min)

Quick verbal quiz to confirm understanding:

1. "A team member tells you another employee made an inappropriate comment to them. What do you do?"
2. "You're running 10 minutes late for your shift. What do you do?"
3. "A friend asks you how much money Jayna makes on a busy Saturday. What do you say?"
4. "You see an employee on their phone in guest view. What do you do?"

**Debrief:**
Discuss answers. There are right answers here—make sure she knows them.

## Trainer Notes

**Tone for This Unit:**
Professional but not cold. This is necessary paperwork, but it's also setting up her success. Frame it as "protecting both of us" rather than "rules you have to follow."

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Rushing through paperwork without explaining it
- Skipping the handbook review because "she can read it later"
- Not actually setting up Homebase and practicing it
- Forgetting to discuss schedule expectations

**End This Unit With:**
"I know paperwork isn't exciting, but it's the foundation that lets everything else work. You're officially part of the team now—let's go meet everyone properly."

---

# UNIT 1.3: MEET THE TEAM — FOH

**Duration:** 2-3 hours (can be spread across first few shifts)  
**Trainer:** Demetri + Team Introductions  
**Location:** Throughout FOH

## Purpose

Heming needs to know her team before she can lead them. This isn't just learning names—it's beginning to build relationships and understanding each person's role and strengths.

## Content to Cover

### FOH Organizational Structure (15 min)

Before meeting individuals, explain the structure.

**Positions:**
- Cashier/Order Taker: First guest contact, order accuracy, upselling
- Expo: Quality control, food delivery, communication hub
- Runner: Food delivery, table maintenance, support
- Bar: Beverage service, cocktails, guest experience
- Host (when applicable): Seating, reservations, first impression

**How They Work Together:**
- The flow from order to delivery
- Who communicates with whom
- The expo as the "quarterback" of FOH service

**Key People to Know:**
- Point out any shift leads or senior team members
- Who has been here longest
- Who to go to with questions when Demetri isn't available

### Individual Introductions (60-90 min)

Introduce Heming to each FOH team member personally. This should feel genuine, not like a parade.

**For Each Person, Cover:**
- Name and role
- How long they've been at Jayna
- One thing they do particularly well
- Something personal (if appropriate to share)

**Heming Should:**
- Shake hands or appropriate greeting
- Make eye contact
- Ask at least one question
- Take mental notes (written notes later)

**Facilitate Connection:**
"[Name], this is Heming, our new Assistant Manager. She's going to be shadowing everyone this week to learn how we operate. Heming, [Name] is incredible at [specific skill]—you should watch how they [specific thing]."

### Shadowing Sessions (30 min each position)

Heming spends at least 30 minutes observing each FOH role during actual service.

**Cashier/Order Taker Shadow:**
- Watch the greeting and order process
- Notice upselling techniques
- See how modifications are handled
- Observe payment processing

**Expo Shadow:**
- Watch quality control checks
- See the communication with kitchen
- Notice how tickets are managed
- Observe food delivery coordination

**Runner Shadow:**
- See table maintenance in action
- Watch food delivery technique
- Notice how they anticipate needs
- Observe the "constant motion" mindset

**Bar Shadow (Brief):**
- Initial exposure (deep training in Module 4)
- See the setup and flow
- Notice guest interaction style
- Understand bar's role in overall service

**After Each Shadow:**
Quick debrief with Heming:
- What did you notice?
- What did they do well?
- What questions do you have?
- What would you want to learn to do?

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Team Roster Creation (Ongoing)

Heming creates a personal document with:
- Every FOH team member's name
- Their role
- How long at Jayna
- One personal detail she learned
- One professional strength she observed

This becomes her reference for managing the team.

### Activity 2: "What I Learned" Observations (After shadowing)

For each position shadowed, Heming writes:
- Three things this role is responsible for
- One thing that surprised her
- One thing she wants to learn more about

## Trainer Notes

**Tone for This Unit:**
Collaborative and curious. Heming is learning, but she's also being introduced as a future leader. Team members should feel respected, not inspected.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Introducing Heming as "the new boss" (she's learning alongside them)
- Rushing through introductions without genuine connection
- Skipping shadow time because "she'll learn on the job"
- Not following up on what she observed

**Tips for Success:**
- Spread this over multiple shifts if needed
- Let Heming shadow during actual service, not just prep
- Encourage her to ask team members questions directly
- Check in: "Who have you not met yet?"

**End This Unit With:**
"You've met the FOH family. Tomorrow we'll do the same with BOH. The kitchen crew is the engine that makes everything possible—let's make sure they know you respect that."

---

# UNIT 1.4: MEET THE TEAM — BOH

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri + Kitchen Manager/Lead  
**Location:** Throughout BOH

## Purpose

Heming must understand and respect BOH operations. As an Assistant Manager, she'll bridge FOH and BOH constantly. Building relationships with kitchen staff now prevents the "us vs. them" dynamic that kills restaurants.

## Content to Cover

### BOH Organizational Structure (15 min)

**Positions:**
- Kitchen Manager / Order Manager: Inventory, ordering, systems, leadership
- Lead Prep Cook: Recipe prep specialist, training, quality control
- Line Cook: Service execution, station management, plating
- Prep Cook / Dishwasher / Cleaner: Prep support, sanitation, dish pit

**The Trilingual Reality:**
- Our BOH team includes English, Spanish, and Turkish speakers
- Respect means meeting people where they are
- Key phrases to learn (optional but impressive)
- Translation resources when needed

**How BOH Works:**
- Prep happens before service (mise en place)
- Line operates during service
- Dish keeps everything moving
- Everyone cleans—it's not just one person's job

### Individual Introductions (45-60 min)

Same approach as FOH—personal, respectful, genuine.

**For Each Person:**
- Name, role, languages spoken
- How long at Jayna
- One thing they do well
- Something Demetri respects about them

**Special Attention:**
- Kitchen Manager: This is a key relationship for ordering, inventory, communication
- Lead Prep: Partner for training, quality standards
- Senior Line Cooks: Respect their experience

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Some team members may be quieter in introductions
- Respect different communication styles
- A smile and respectful demeanor transcend language

### Kitchen Observation (45-60 min)

Heming observes each BOH station during active work.

**Prep Area Observation:**
- Watch recipe preparation
- See the scale and precision required
- Notice the organization system
- Understand what "mise en place" means in practice

**Line Observation:**
- Watch orders come in and get executed
- See the gyro shaving technique
- Notice the pace during a rush
- Observe communication (tickets called, responses)

**Dish Pit Observation:**
- Understand the volume and pace
- See how clean dishes get staged
- Notice the role in keeping FOH stocked
- Appreciate the physical demands

**Follow an Order:**
Watch a single order from:
- Ticket printing
- Items being prepared at each station
- Plating and quality check
- Handoff to expo
- Delivery to guest

This is the full picture of what BOH does for every single order.

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: BOH Team Roster (Ongoing)

Same as FOH:
- Every BOH team member's name
- Their role and languages spoken
- One personal detail
- One professional strength

### Activity 2: Order Flow Diagram (After observation)

Heming draws or describes the journey of an order:
- Where does it start?
- What stations does it touch?
- Where are the handoffs?
- Where could things go wrong?

This builds her understanding of the system.

### Activity 3: Communication Bridge Practice (Optional)

If comfortable, Heming practices basic communication:
- Thanking a line cook for a plate (in Spanish or Turkish if she wants to try)
- Asking "How can I help?" during a rush
- Acknowledging good work specifically

## Trainer Notes

**Tone for This Unit:**
Humble and respectful. BOH often feels underappreciated. Heming should enter their space as a learner, not a manager.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Treating BOH tour as less important than FOH
- Not introducing Heming properly to kitchen team
- Skipping dish pit ("it's just dishes")
- Not explaining the trilingual dynamic

**Critical Point:**
"As Assistant Manager, you will never succeed if BOH doesn't respect you. Respect is earned by knowing what they do, appreciating how hard it is, and never asking them to do something you wouldn't do yourself."

**End This Unit With:**
"Now you've met the whole Jayna family. FOH and BOH are one team—we succeed or fail together. Your job is to make that connection stronger, not create division."

# UNIT 1.5: THE GUEST EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Dining room + office for discussion

## Purpose

This is the heart of Module 1. Everything else—operations, bar, management—serves this philosophy. Heming must internalize what Jayna hospitality means before she can deliver or teach it.

## Content to Cover

### Deep Dive: Guest Experience SOP (60-90 min)

Read through the entire SOP: Guest Experience and Greek Hospitality Standards together. Don't just skim—discuss each section.

**"About This SOP":**
- This isn't a checklist—it's a North Star
- The WHY behind everything we do
- "We don't just feed people—we welcome them into something real"

**"Who We Are":**
- Fine-casual Greek and Mediterranean
- Full bar, full flavor, full hospitality
- "Serve guests like family because that's how we were raised"

**"Why Guest Experience is Everything":**
- "We don't sell food. We sell belonging."
- **THE LINE:** "The gyro is the vehicle—hospitality is the destination."
- Reading people, meeting them there, elevating touchpoints
- "Guests should leave feeling like something different just happened to them"

**"Meet Demetri" Section:**
- You already covered this in Unit 1.1, but revisit it
- Connect your personal story to the hospitality philosophy
- "This isn't a corporate initiative—it's who I am"

**The Five-Second Rule:**
- Within 5 seconds: greeted, eye contact, loud warm welcome
- The guest's inner monologue without greeting: "Am I supposed to seat myself?"
- "We CANCEL AWKWARDNESS on arrival"
- EVERYONE'S job—bar, expo, even if you're cleaning bathrooms

**Balancing "Fine" and "Casual":**
- Counter service but hospitality doesn't stop there
- Check on tables, clear and manicure, deliver food hot and beautiful
- Know ingredients, wine, bar—and be proud
- Refills, small touches, human moments

**"Channel Your Inner Greek":**
- Eye contact and smile first
- Know and love the food—have favorites, gush about them
- Share stories (tzatziki made like Demetri's family in Greece)
- Serve with generosity—anticipate needs
- Charm, not confuse—help guests, don't make them feel dumb

**The Bar Note:**
- Serve stories, not just booze
- Recommend with confidence
- Learn one new thing each week, share with guests

**What Success Looks Like:**
- Welcomed immediately
- Relax into the vibe quickly
- Trust us to guide their experience
- Tell friends, come back
- **Feel like family**
- "We don't just want them full—we want them GLOWING"

**Unreasonable Hospitality:**
- Not about doing everything—doing the RIGHT thing for the RIGHT person at the RIGHT moment
- Compliment, free ouzo for engagement, offering a fork to struggling guest
- These extras turn service into hospitality, hospitality into loyalty

### The Five-Second Rule Deep Practice (30 min)

This is non-negotiable. Practice until it's automatic.

**The Standard:**
- 5 seconds from entry
- Eye contact
- Loud, warm greeting across the restaurant
- "WELCOME!" or "YIASOU!" or "HEY THERE, FRIENDS!"

**Why It Matters:**
- First impression happens in seconds
- Awkwardness kills the experience before it starts
- A greeted guest immediately feels they're in good hands

**Practice Scenarios:**
1. Guest walks in during lunch rush—you're at the bar
2. Family of four enters while you're bussing a table
3. Solo diner enters looking at their phone
4. Regulars walk in
5. Someone enters but hovers at the door looking confused

For each: What do you say? How loud? Do you stop what you're doing?

### Reading the Room Introduction (30 min)

Preview of deeper content in Module 3, but introduce concepts now.

**Guest Energy Types:**
- Excited/Celebratory: Match their energy, don't dampen it
- Tired/Stressed: Calm, efficient, don't overwhelm
- Confused/First-Time: Guide gently, no assumptions
- Regulars: Recognition, familiarity, don't over-explain
- In a Rush: Speed, accuracy, no unnecessary chat
- On a Date: Give space, be attentive but not intrusive

**The Skill:**
Reading body language, tone, pace—and adjusting your approach in real-time.

"You serve each guest differently because each guest IS different. The goal is the same—make them feel cared for—but the method changes."

### Unreasonable Hospitality Concept (30 min)

From the book "Unreasonable Hospitality" by Will Guidara—adapted for Jayna.

**The Philosophy:**
- Go beyond what's expected
- Small gestures, massive impact
- It doesn't have to cost money
- It DOES require paying attention

**Jayna Examples:**
- Remembering a regular's name and order
- Noticing someone struggling with pita and offering a fork without them asking
- Complimenting a guest's outfit genuinely
- Bringing extra napkins before they're needed
- Free baklava for a birthday
- Shot of ouzo for an engagement or celebration
- Walking a guest's to-go order to their car in the rain

**The Mindset:**
"What could I do right now that would make this person's day better?"

Not everything. Not every table. The RIGHT thing for the RIGHT person at the RIGHT moment.

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Five-Second Rule Practice (20 min)

Role-play the greeting repeatedly.

Demetri plays different guest types:
- Confident walker
- Hesitant, looking around
- Distracted, on phone
- Group of friends, loud
- Solo, quiet

Heming practices greeting each appropriately. Repeat until it feels natural, not scripted.

### Activity 2: Floor Observation (30 min)

During active service, Heming observes from a neutral position (not working, just watching).

**Assignment:**
- Watch 10 guest entries
- Note: Were they greeted within 5 seconds? By whom?
- Rate the greeting: 1-5 (energy, warmth, timing)
- Identify 3 moments of great hospitality she witnessed
- Identify 3 missed opportunities

**Debrief:**
Discuss observations. What patterns emerged? What would she have done differently?

### Activity 3: Unreasonable Hospitality Brainstorm (15 min)

Heming brainstorms 10 potential "unreasonable hospitality" moments she could create:
- Low/no cost
- Personalized
- Memorable

Share and discuss. Which are practical? Which would Demetri want to see?

## Trainer Notes

**Tone for This Unit:**
Inspirational but grounded. This is the soul of Jayna—Heming should feel moved by it, not just informed. Get passionate. Tell stories. Make it real.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Reading the SOP like a policy document instead of a philosophy
- Skipping the practice (Five-Second Rule must be practiced, not just explained)
- Not connecting it to your personal story
- Making it feel optional ("nice to have") rather than essential

**The Test:**
If Heming can't explain why hospitality matters at Jayna—in her own words, with conviction—this unit isn't complete.

**End This Unit With:**
"Everything you learn from here forward—opening checklists, cocktail recipes, HR paperwork—all of it serves this philosophy. If you ever wonder why we do something, the answer usually connects back to what we talked about today. Questions?"

---

# UNIT 1.6: MENU IMMERSION

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri + BOH support for tasting  
**Location:** Kitchen + dining room

## Purpose

Heming can't sell what she doesn't know. She can't answer guest questions, handle allergies, or train staff on menu if she hasn't experienced it herself. This unit creates menu fluency.

## Content to Cover

### Menu Walkthrough (60-90 min)

Go through every menu item systematically.

**For Each Item, Cover:**
- What it is (description)
- How it's made (brief—not full recipe)
- What makes it special
- Common modifications

### Allergen Deep Dive (30 min)

Using the Jayna Menu and Allergen Guide:

**Major Allergens to Know:**
- Gluten: where it hides (pita, soup, sauces)
- Dairy: tzatziki, feta, kefir cheese, rice pudding
- Eggs: certain sauces, burger components
- Sesame: tahini in hummus and baba ganoush
- Tree Nuts: pine nuts in dolmas, baklava
- Shellfish: octopus
- Soy: possible in some prepared ingredients

**For Each Menu Item:**
- Know the allergens
- Know what can be modified out
- Know what can't be modified (cross-contamination risks)

**The Golden Rules:**
- When in doubt, check with kitchen
- Never guess on allergies—a wrong answer can kill someone
- Document allergy requests on the ticket
- "I'll check with our kitchen" is always acceptable

### Menu Tasting (45-60 min)

**Heming tastes at least 8-10 core menu items:**

Priority tasting list:
1. Beef & Lamb Gyro (signature)
2. Chicken Gyro
3. Falafel
4. Greek Fries
5. Hummus with pita
6. Tzatziki
7. One soup (seasonal)
8. Baklava (at least 2 varieties)
9. One specialty (octopus or iskender if available)
10. Frozen yogurt

**While Tasting:**
- Note flavors, textures, what stands out
- Think about how you'd describe this to a guest
- Ask BOH questions about preparation
- Consider: what would you recommend this to?

### Building Menu Enthusiasm (30 min)

Selling food isn't reciting ingredients—it's transferring enthusiasm.

**Practice Descriptions:**

Instead of: "That's beef and lamb gyro meat with vegetables and sauce."

Try: "Our beef and lamb gyro is our signature—it's a perfect blend of seasoned meat, shaved to order right off the vertical spit. The meat is crispy on the edges, tender in the middle. With our housemade tzatziki and fresh vegetables in warm pita? It's the dish that made us famous."

**For Each Core Item:**
- One sentence description (quick)
- Enthusiastic description (when guest wants more)
- Personal recommendation ("I love it with extra spicy aioli")

**Common Guest Questions:**
- "What's good here?" → Have an answer ready
- "What's your favorite?" → Be genuine, be specific
- "What do you recommend for [dietary need]?" → Know the options
- "Is this spicy?" → Know the heat levels
- "What's the portion size?" → Be able to describe accurately

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Menu Tasting Log

While tasting, Heming completes a log:

| Item | Flavor Notes | Texture | Would Recommend To | My Enthusiasm Pitch |
|------|--------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Beef Gyro | | | | |
| etc. | | | | |

### Activity 2: Allergen Quiz

Rapid-fire allergen questions:

1. Guest has celiac disease. What can they eat?
2. Guest is allergic to sesame. What should they avoid?
3. Guest is vegan. What are their options?
4. Guest can't have dairy. Can they have tzatziki? What's the alternative?
5. Guest has a tree nut allergy. Is baklava safe?

### Activity 3: Selling the Menu Role-Play

Demetri plays different guests:
1. "What's good here? It's my first time."
2. "I want something healthy but filling."
3. "My kid is picky—what would they like?"
4. "I'm vegetarian. What are my options?"
5. "I want the most authentic Greek thing you have."

Heming recommends and describes with enthusiasm.

## Trainer Notes

**Tone for This Unit:**
Delicious and proud. Heming should leave hungry and excited to share this food with guests. Make her FEEL the quality.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Skipping the tasting ("she can try things on her own time")
- Just listing ingredients without stories
- Not practicing enthusiastic descriptions
- Glossing over allergens (this is safety-critical)

**The Test:**
A guest asks "What should I get?" Heming should have an immediate, enthusiastic, personalized recommendation ready.

**End This Unit With:**
"You've now tasted what you're selling. You know the stories, the allergens, the modifications. When you talk about our food, it's not from a menu—it's from experience. That authenticity? Guests feel it."
