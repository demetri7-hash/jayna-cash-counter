# MODULE 2: OPERATIONS MASTERY
## "Systems create freedom. Master the systems, and you'll never feel lost."

**Trainee:** Heming Huang, Assistant Manager  
**Primary Trainer:** Demetri Gregorakis (Opening, Transition, Closing, Cash)  
**Bar Closing Trainer:** Kat  
**Estimated Duration:** 24-30 hours across 6 training units

---

## MODULE OVERVIEW

Operations are the skeleton that holds hospitality together. Without clean systems, consistent execution, and attention to detail, even the best intentions fall apart. This module transforms Heming from observer to operator—someone who can open, run, and close the restaurant independently.

### Why This Module Matters

As Assistant Manager, Heming will often be the senior person on shift. She needs to:
- Open the restaurant to standard without supervision
- Execute flawless transitions that set up the next crew for success
- Close properly, including cash handling and security
- Identify when something isn't done right and fix it

The checklists aren't bureaucracy—they're the accumulated wisdom of what goes wrong when steps are skipped.

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

By the end of Module 2, Heming can:

- [ ] Open the restaurant solo (all FOH opening duties completed to standard)
- [ ] Execute a flawless mid-shift transition
- [ ] Close the restaurant solo (all FOH closing duties completed, cash handled correctly)
- [ ] Close the bar independently (all bar closing duties completed)
- [ ] Use the 1-5 rating scale to evaluate shift quality
- [ ] Identify and correct deficiencies left by previous shifts
- [ ] Complete cash handling procedures without error
- [ ] Understand and apply FIFO, par levels, and inventory basics
- [ ] Leave notes that actually help the next crew

# UNIT 2.1: OPENING PROCEDURES — THEORY

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Walk through entire FOH

## Purpose

Before Heming opens independently, she needs to understand every line item on the checklist—not just WHAT to do, but WHY it matters.

## The Philosophy of Opening

"Opening isn't about checking boxes—it's about creating the stage for hospitality."

**The Standard:**
- When doors open at 11 AM, the restaurant should feel like it's been open for hours
- Every guest who walks in should feel welcomed into a polished, ready environment
- No scrambling, no apologizing, no "we just opened"

## FOH Opening Checklist — Complete Breakdown

### DINING ROOM & PATIO SETUP

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Remove chairs and re-wipe all tables | Dust settles overnight; start fresh |
| Wipe table sides, legs, chairs, banquette sofas | Guests see and touch all surfaces |
| Top wood ledge of sofas (especially outside) | Dust magnet; guests rest arms here |
| Chairs tucked, tables aligned and spaced | Visual consistency signals attention |
| Lamps on tables, cables hidden | Ambiance; cables are eyesores |
| "Salt to the Street" orientation | Consistency in every detail |
| Menus wiped and dry | Sticky menus = "this place is dirty" |
| All lights on | Know your switches |
| Doors unlocked, signs flipped | Only after EVERYTHING is ready |
| Rollups checked and refilled | Enough for service plus buffer |
| Patio tables and barstools wiped fresh | Outdoor = overnight dust |
| Blinds raised | Natural light, welcoming feel |
| Front doors Windexed | First touch point for guests |
| Register fronts wiped | Guest-facing surface |

### CLEANLINESS & WALKTHROUGH

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Sweep perimeter, remove cobwebs | Cobwebs = neglect perception |
| Review previous closing notes | Information handoff |

### BATHROOM VERIFICATION (Critical)

BOH cleaner handles deep cleaning. FOH opener VERIFIES.

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Toilets: bowl, lid, seat, under, floor around | If not done, YOU do it |
| Mirrors Windexed | Guests check themselves here |
| Dust: dryer top, soap dispenser, wall perimeter | Details while sitting |
| Sink scrubbed, drain mold removed | Pink/black = unacceptable |
| Surfaces dried and polished | Water spots = not finished |
| Fully restocked: TP, towels, seat covers | Full, not "enough" |

**IF NOT OK: Clean yourself, notify Demetri immediately**

### EXPO STATION & SAUCE PREP

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Sanitation tub: ¾ sanitizer, 2 towels, 1 hanging (health code) | Required by law |
| Expo towels: 1 damp (plates), 1 dry (surfaces) | Right tools for each job |
| Sauce backups: Tzatziki, Spicy Aioli, Lemon (filled ramekins) | Grab-and-go during rush |
| Squeeze bottles full and clean | For plating drizzles |

### KITCHEN SUPPORT & RESTOCK

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Bring out sauces, mark finished | Communicate with BOH |
| Stock plates and bowls from drying rack | Line needs dishes ready |
| Restock to-go containers (above hand sink) | Must appear full |
| Restock baklava: retail and POS | Visual merchandising |

### WATER STATION — "Abundant Spa Vibe"

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| 2 cucumbers: thick ribbons (mandolin) | Visual impact in Station 1 |
| 4 lemons: thick wheels | Fancy, abundant in Station 2 |
| Both dispensers: ice, fruit, water | Luxurious and inviting |

### BAR SETUP

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Ice well overflowing | Bar can't function without ice |
| Garnish container: ice + water for fruit | Keeps fruit fresh |
| Juices, syrups: full, clean, labeled, dated | Check dates |
| Batch cocktails: day-use full, backups ready | Speed during service |
| Bar caddies: straws, napkins, froyo spoons | Guest supplies stocked |

### FROYO MACHINES

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Large: STOP → AUTO | Activates for service |
| Small: verify cold, FRESH mode overnight, stir | Product consistency |
| 1 batch ready, 1 labeled backup in wine fridge | Prep if missing |

### WINES BY THE GLASS

| Task | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| Whites/bubbles in fridge, reds on bar | Proper temperature |
| Confirm open dates | Wine has shelf life |
| Taste if questionable, DUMP IF BAD | Never serve bad wine |

## The Rating System

After opening, rate the previous closer's work.

**1-5 Scale:**
- 1 = Major Issues (unacceptable)
- 3 = Acceptable (meets minimum)
- 5 = Guest-Ready (perfect)

**Categories:** Dining rooms, Expo, Sauces, Cashier, Silver, Fro-yo, Office, Bar

## Key Concepts

### FIFO = First In, First Out
- Oldest product used first
- New goes BEHIND old
- Dates and labels make this possible

### Par Levels
- Standard amount we should have
- "At par" = right amount
- "Below par" = restock needed

## Hands-On Activities

1. **Checklist Walkthrough** (45 min) - Walk every station, locate supplies
2. **Water Station Practice** (15 min) - Cut cucumbers/lemons, build dispenser
3. **Table Setting Practice** (10 min) - Salt to Street, alignment, lamps
