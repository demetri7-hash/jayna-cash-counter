# MODULE 3: GUEST EXPERIENCE & SERVICE RECOVERY
## "Hospitality isn't about being perfect. It's about how fast and gracefully we respond when we mess up."

**Trainee:** Heming Huang, Assistant Manager  
**Primary Trainer:** Demetri Gregorakis  
**Estimated Duration:** 18-22 hours across 6 training units

---

## MODULE OVERVIEW

This module is the heart of what separates Jayna from every other restaurant. Operations can be copied. Recipes can be imitated. But the way we make guests FEEL? That's our competitive advantage.

Heming will learn to read people, create memorable moments, and—critically—recover gracefully when things go wrong. Because things WILL go wrong. The measure of our hospitality is not perfection; it's response.

# UNIT 3.1: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HOSPITALITY

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Dining room + office discussion

## Purpose

Before learning techniques, Heming must understand the psychology of WHY hospitality works. This is the foundation that makes everything else meaningful.

## Content to Cover

### What Guests Really Want (30 min)

Beyond food and drink, every guest walks in with deeper needs:

**To Be Seen:**
- Acknowledged immediately
- Recognized as an individual, not a transaction
- Not invisible, not waiting

**To Be Heard:**
- Their preferences matter
- Their questions are welcome
- Their concerns are taken seriously

**To Be Valued:**
- They chose us over other options
- Their time and money are appreciated
- They're treated like family, not cattle

**The Insight:**
"When you understand what guests REALLY want, you stop worrying about scripts and start connecting as humans."

### The Emotional Journey of a Restaurant Visit (30 min)

Walk through the guest experience emotionally:

**Arrival (Anticipation → First Impression)**
- Walking from car to door: "Will this be good?"
- First 5 seconds inside: "Am I welcome here?"
- This moment shapes everything that follows

**Ordering (Uncertainty → Confidence)**
- Looking at menu: "What should I get?"
- Interacting with staff: "Do they know what's good?"
- Making a choice: "Did I choose right?"

**Waiting (Patience → Anxiety)**
- First few minutes: Fine
- Beyond expected time: "Did they forget me?"
- Any acknowledgment helps: "Your food is coming right up"

**Eating (Expectation → Reality)**
- First bite: Does it match expectation?
- Throughout meal: Am I being cared for?
- Problems arise: How are they handled?

**Leaving (Reflection → Memory)**
- Paying: Friction or ease?
- Final interaction: Do they want me back?
- Walking out: What do I remember?

**The Insight:**
"You're not just serving food—you're guiding people through an emotional experience. Every touchpoint either builds or breaks the feeling."

### The Five-Second Window (20 min)

**The Science:**
- First impressions form in 3-5 seconds
- They're nearly impossible to change
- Everything after is filtered through that first moment

**At Jayna:**
- Within 5 seconds of entry: acknowledged
- Eye contact made
- Warm, audible greeting

**What Happens Without It:**
Guest's inner monologue:
- "Is anyone working here?"
- "Am I supposed to seat myself?"
- "Maybe I should just leave..."

**What Happens With It:**
Guest's inner monologue:
- "Oh good, they see me"
- "This feels welcoming"
- "I'm in good hands"

**The Practice:**
The greeting is EVERYONE'S job. Doesn't matter if you're at the bar, clearing a table, or walking to the bathroom. SEE the guest. GREET the guest.

### Service vs. Hospitality (20 min)

**Service is transactional:**
- Take order
- Deliver food
- Process payment
- Done

**Hospitality is relational:**
- Make connection
- Anticipate needs
- Create moments
- Build relationship

**Service asks:** "What does this person need?"
**Hospitality asks:** "How can I make this person feel?"

**The Difference in Action:**

| Service | Hospitality |
|---------|-------------|
| "Here's your food" | "Here's your gyro—the lamb is especially good today. Enjoy!" |
| Refill water when asked | Refill water before they notice it's low |
| Answer menu questions | Offer recommendations based on their preferences |
| Fix mistakes | Fix mistakes AND add a gesture to make up for it |

### "Canceling Awkwardness" (15 min)

Every moment of confusion or uncertainty is awkward for the guest. Our job is to CANCEL that awkwardness before it compounds.

**Awkward Moments We Cancel:**

| Awkward Situation | How We Cancel It |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Guest walks in, unsure where to go | Immediate greeting with clear direction |
| Guest can't pronounce "gyro" | Say it naturally, no correction, no condescension |
| Guest is deciding and feels rushed | "Take your time—I'm here when you're ready" |
| Guest struggles to eat pita wrap | Offer fork without being asked |
| Guest looks confused after ordering | "You can grab a table anywhere—we'll bring it out" |
| Guest's food is taking longer | Proactive update: "Just a couple more minutes" |

**The Mindset:**
Anticipate what might feel awkward. Remove it before they feel it.

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Guest Entry Observation (30 min)

During service, Heming observes 10 guests entering:
- Were they greeted within 5 seconds?
- Who greeted them?
- What was the guest's energy before and after greeting?
- Rate each greeting (1-5)

Document observations for debrief.

### Activity 2: Greeting Practice (20 min)

Role-play guest arrivals:

**Scenario 1:** Confident group of friends, excited energy  
**Scenario 2:** Solo diner, looking at phone, quiet  
**Scenario 3:** Family with kids, slightly overwhelmed  
**Scenario 4:** Couple on a date, looking around curiously  
**Scenario 5:** Regular who comes every week  
**Scenario 6:** Person who looks frustrated before even entering  

For each: Practice the greeting. Adjust energy to match/complement.

### Activity 3: Awkwardness Anticipation (15 min)

Walk through the restaurant and identify:
- 5 moments where a guest might feel awkward
- How we currently cancel (or don't cancel) each
- One improvement for each

## Reflection Questions

1. The difference between service and hospitality is...
2. When a guest walks in looking overwhelmed, I should...
3. When a guest walks in with celebration energy, I should...
4. The first 5 seconds matter because...
5. One awkward moment I want to get better at canceling is...

# UNIT 3.2: READING THE ROOM

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Floor during service + debrief

## Purpose

Great hospitality requires reading people—understanding what they need without being told. This unit develops Heming's observation skills and adaptability.

## Content to Cover

### Non-Verbal Communication (30 min)

**What Guests Tell Us Without Words:**

**Body Language Signals:**
| Signal | Might Mean |
|--------|------------|
| Leaning back, arms crossed | Closed off, waiting, frustrated |
| Leaning forward, engaged | Interested, comfortable |
| Looking around, trying to make eye contact | Needs something |
| Checking phone repeatedly | Waiting for someone, or bored |
| Pushed plate away | Done eating |
| Napkin on table | Preparing to leave |
| Fidgeting, checking watch | In a hurry |
| Deep in conversation, not noticing you | Give space |

**Facial Expressions:**
- Furrowed brow: confused or frustrated
- Scanning menu with pursed lips: overwhelmed by choices
- Smiling at food: satisfied
- Flat expression while eating: could be neutral or disappointed

**Tone of Voice:**
- Short answers: may want efficiency, not chat
- Enthusiastic questions: wants engagement
- Hesitant ordering: unsure, needs guidance
- Clipped or tense: something may be wrong

### Guest Energy Types (30 min)

Different guests need different approaches:

**The Celebrators:**
- Here for a special occasion
- Energy: high, excited, social
- Approach: Match enthusiasm, acknowledge the occasion, make it special
- "Are we celebrating something tonight?"

**The Regulars:**
- Know the place, know what they want
- Energy: comfortable, familiar
- Approach: Recognition, efficiency, don't over-explain
- "The usual, or trying something new today?"

**The Exhausted:**
- Long day, just want to eat
- Energy: low, tired, minimal
- Approach: Efficient, calm, don't overwhelm
- "I'll get this started for you right away"

**The First-Timers:**
- Curious but uncertain
- Energy: inquisitive, maybe nervous
- Approach: Guide gently, explain without condescension
- "First time here? Let me tell you about our favorites"

**The Rushed:**
- Limited time, need speed
- Energy: checking watch, quick decisions
- Approach: Acknowledge time constraint, prioritize speed
- "Short on time? I'll put this in right away"

**The Date Night:**
- Focused on each other
- Energy: intimate, don't want interruption
- Approach: Attentive but minimal intrusion
- Quick check-ins, read when to give space

**The Business Meal:**
- Discussion is the focus
- Energy: professional, food is secondary
- Approach: Seamless service, don't interrupt conversations
- Time courses appropriately

**The Families:**
- Kids change dynamics
- Energy: chaotic, parents stressed
- Approach: Help with kids subtly, patience
- Quick kid food, crayons, understanding

### The "Scan" Technique (20 min)

Constantly aware without hovering.

**How to Scan:**
- Every 2-3 minutes, eyes sweep your section
- Look for: empty glasses, finished plates, looking-around body language
- Quick mental checklist: Does anyone need anything?

**What You're Looking For:**
- Water levels (refill before empty)
- Finished plates (clear promptly but not rushed)
- Confused looks (approach and help)
- Check-seeking behavior (ready for next step)
- Hands raised (respond immediately)

**The Balance:**
- Attentive ≠ Hovering
- Present ≠ Intrusive
- Anticipating ≠ Assuming

### Timing Awareness (20 min)

**When to Approach:**
- After food is delivered: 2-bite check-in
- When plates are nearly clear: offer dessert/box
- When conversation pauses: natural moment for check-in
- When you see a need: immediately

**When to Give Space:**
- Deep in conversation
- Clearly on an important call
- Romantic moment
- Just received food and taking first bites

**The Test:**
If approaching would interrupt something meaningful, wait. If waiting would leave a need unmet, approach.

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: "Narrate the Room" Exercise (30 min)

During service, Demetri and Heming walk the floor together.

Heming narrates what she observes about each table:
- What type of guests are they?
- What's their energy?
- What might they need?
- When should we check on them?

Demetri provides feedback and different perspectives.

### Activity 2: The Scan Practice (20 min)

Heming practices scanning:
- Set timer for 3 minutes
- Scan, identify every table's status
- Write quick notes
- Check accuracy by approaching tables

### Activity 3: Anticipation Challenge (20 min)

During service, Heming identifies 3 tables that need something BEFORE they ask:
- What she observed
- What she provided
- Guest reaction

Document for debrief.

## Reflection Questions

# UNIT 3.3: COMPLAINT HANDLING — THEORY

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Office (discussion) + floor (role-play)

## Purpose

Complaints are inevitable. How we handle them determines whether we lose a guest forever or create a loyal fan. This unit teaches the Jayna approach to service recovery.

## Content to Cover

### SOP: Problems — Complete Review (45 min)

Read through the entire SOP together:

**What NOT to Do:**
- ❌ Act defensive or confused
- ❌ Waste time checking POS, kitchen slip, or ticket before acting
- ❌ Make the guest wait while you investigate
- ❌ Ask them to "prove" their order
- ❌ Assume they're exaggerating or scamming

**What TO Do:**

**Step 1: Take Ownership Immediately**
- "That's completely our fault. I'm so sorry."
- "We missed that. Let me fix it right now."
- No investigating first. No hedging. OWN IT.

**Step 2: Sympathize and Validate**
- "That's such a bummer—I totally understand why you're frustrated."
- "Thank you for letting me know."
- Mean it. Don't script it.

**Step 3: Fix It Fast**
- Don't check tickets first
- If they say something's missing—GET IT MADE OTF (On The Fly)
- Walk it to the table hot and fresh with apology and warmth

**Step 4: Follow Up**
- "Is there anything else I can do to make this right?"
- Small extras: baklava, shot of ouzo, extra sauce
- Show you care beyond the fix

### The Psychology of Complaints (20 min)

**Why This Matters:**

Statistics that should haunt you:
- Guests share bad experiences with 9-15 people on average
- 13% will tell over 20 people
- Only 1 in 10 share good experiences unless prompted
- Negative word-of-mouth spreads 2-3x faster than positive
- One badly handled complaint can cost hundreds of potential guests

**The Opportunity:**

But here's the flip side:
- A recovered complaint can create MORE loyalty than no problem at all
- The guest who complains is giving you a CHANCE
- 95% of complainers will return if resolved quickly and well
- They become your biggest advocates

**The Insight:**
"A complaint isn't a crisis—it's an opportunity. The guest who complains cares enough to tell you. The dangerous ones leave silently and never return."

### Phone Complaint Protocol (15 min)

When someone calls to complain:

**Immediately say:**
"I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm really glad you called us. Let me fix this for you right away."

**Then:**
1. Apologize and sympathize
2. Get their name and phone number
3. Pass to Demetri (preferred) or MOD immediately
4. If neither available: Write down issue clearly, assure callback within the hour

**Never:**
- Argue
- Delay
- Say "that's not possible" or "I don't know"

### Language That Works (20 min)

**Phrases to Steal:**
- "That's completely our fault, and I'm so sorry."
- "Let me take care of that right now."
- "Thank you for bringing this to our attention."
- "We really appreciate you giving us a chance to fix it."
- "We want you to leave loving your experience here."
- "Let me grab my manager to make sure this gets handled right."

**Phrases to NEVER Use:**
- "That's not what I heard from the kitchen"
- "Are you sure you ordered that?"
- "Let me check the ticket"
- "That's our policy"
- "There's nothing I can do"
- "It's not my fault"
- "You should have said something sooner"

### The Empowerment Principle (15 min)

**"You will never be in trouble for fixing a guest problem quickly and generously."**

Read that again.

**What This Means:**
- You ARE empowered to comp, fix, replace
- You DON'T need permission for obvious fixes
- The cost of a free side is nothing compared to a lost guest
- Act first, document later

**What You CAN Do Without Asking:**
- Replace wrong or cold food immediately
- Comp a small item (side, dessert, drink)
- Offer a genuine apology and extra
- Make it right on the spot

**When to Get Demetri:**
- Comps over $50
- Guest still upset after your recovery
- Threats of bad reviews or legal action
- Injury or health concern
- Anything that feels beyond your authority

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Complaint Role-Play (40 min)

Practice with these scenarios:

**Scenario 1: "My fries are missing"**
- Practice immediate response
- Get the fries made
- Follow up

**Scenario 2: "This gyro is cold"**
- Own it
- Replace immediately
- Add a gesture

**Scenario 3: "We've been waiting 25 minutes"**
- Validate frustration
- Apologize
- Check on food, give update
- Consider comp

**Scenario 4: "I ordered chicken, this is beef"**
- Don't question them
- Replace immediately
- Let them keep wrong item if edible

**Scenario 5: Phone call - "I got home and my order was wrong"**
- Apologize
- Get information
- Hand off or make immediate offer

For each: Practice until the language feels natural, not scripted.

### Activity 2: Language Drill (15 min)

Rapid-fire: Demetri says a guest complaint, Heming responds with first words only.

Goal: Immediate ownership language should be automatic.

## Reflection Questions

1. When a guest complains, my first words should be...
2. I should NEVER say ___ because...
3. The three steps of service recovery are...
4. I can fix problems without asking permission when...
5. I should get Demetri involved when...

# UNIT 3.4: COMPLAINT HANDLING — PRACTICE

**Duration:** 4-6 hours (across multiple shifts)  
**Trainer:** Demetri (observing)  
**Location:** Floor during service

## Purpose

Theory becomes instinct through practice. This unit provides real-world experience with complaint handling while Demetri observes and coaches.

## Structure

### Real Situation Handling

Over multiple shifts, Heming handles real guest complaints as they arise.

**Demetri's Role:**
- Stay visible but not intrusive
- Let Heming take the lead
- Intervene only if situation escalates
- Debrief after each interaction

**Heming's Role:**
- Take ownership of complaints in her section
- Apply the 4-step process
- Make comp decisions within authority
- Escalate when appropriate

### After Each Complaint

Quick debrief (2-5 min):
- What happened?
- What did you say first?
- How did the guest respond?
- What would you do differently?
- What went well?

### Goals for This Unit

Heming should handle at least:
- [ ] 3 food-related complaints (wrong item, cold, missing)
- [ ] 1 wait time complaint
- [ ] 1 comp decision made independently
- [ ] 1 escalation to Demetri (even if manufactured)

## Coaching Points

**Common Mistakes to Watch For:**
- Explaining or defending before apologizing
- Checking ticket before taking action
- Asking guest to prove their order
- Offering fix without warmth
- Not following up after fix

**Signs of Progress:**
- Immediate ownership language
- Physical movement toward solution (not standing and explaining)
- Genuine empathy (not scripted)
- Appropriate comp without prompting
- Follow-up check

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Handle Real Complaints (Ongoing)

This unit IS the activity. Document each complaint handled:

| Date | Complaint | My Response | Outcome | What I Learned |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Activity 2: Independent Comp Decision

Make at least one comp decision without asking Demetri:
- What was the situation?
- What did you comp?
- Why was this the right call?
- Guest reaction?

### Activity 3: Escalation Practice

Even if no situation requires it, practice escalating:
- Identify a hypothetical situation that would need Demetri
- Practice the handoff: "Let me get my manager—she'll make sure this is handled perfectly"
- Debrief the handoff

## Reflection Questions

1. Today I handled a complaint about ___. I said ___ and did ___. The result was ___.
2. One thing I would do differently next time is...
3. I escalated to Demetri when ___ because...
4. The comp decision I made independently was ___ because...
5. The guest feedback that felt most genuine was when I...

# UNIT 3.5: UNREASONABLE HOSPITALITY MOMENTS

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Floor + office discussion

## Purpose

Beyond fixing problems, great hospitality creates unexpected moments of delight. This unit trains Heming to see and create these opportunities.

## Content to Cover

### The Concept (20 min)

From "Unreasonable Hospitality" by Will Guidara:

**It's not about doing everything—it's about doing the RIGHT thing for the RIGHT person at the RIGHT moment.**

**The Philosophy:**
- Go beyond expected
- Small gestures, massive impact
- Doesn't have to cost money
- DOES require paying attention
- Personalized > Generic

### Jayna Examples (20 min)

**Low/No Cost:**
- Complimenting a guest's outfit genuinely
- Remembering a regular's name and order
- Noticing someone struggling with pita—offering fork without them asking
- Extra napkins before they're needed
- Acknowledging someone's milestone (graduation shirt, birthday balloon)

**Small Cost:**
- Free baklava for a birthday you notice
- Shot of ouzo for an engagement
- Extra sauce for someone who clearly loves it
- Kids' activity page without being asked

**Above and Beyond:**
- Walking a to-go order to their car in the rain
- Holding the door for someone with full hands
- Making a special modification not on the menu
- Calling to follow up after a complaint

### Seeing Opportunities (20 min)

**How to Spot Them:**

Listen for:
- "We're celebrating..."
- "It's my first time here"
- "I've been craving this all week"
- "This is exactly what I needed"

Watch for:
- Birthday balloons, gift bags
- Dressed up more than usual
- Children's first experiences
- Couples who seem extra happy
- Someone alone who might appreciate connection

**The Question:**
"What could I do right now that would make this person's day better?"

Not every table. Not every time. The RIGHT moment.

### The "One Per Shift" Challenge (10 min)

**Goal:** Create at least one unreasonable hospitality moment every shift.

**Rules:**
- Must be genuine (not performative)
- Must be personalized (not generic)
- Can be tiny (compliment) or bigger (free item)
- Document what you did and guest reaction

**Why:**
- Builds the habit of looking for opportunities
- Creates stories guests tell
- Differentiates Jayna
- Feels good for everyone

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Opportunity Spotting (30 min)

During service, identify:
- 5 potential unreasonable hospitality opportunities
- What you would do for each
- Which 1-2 are the "right" moments

Document without acting on all of them—the goal is SEEING opportunities.

### Activity 2: Execute One Moment (During shift)

Actually create one unreasonable hospitality moment:
- What did you notice?
- What did you do?
- Guest reaction?
- How did it feel?

### Activity 3: Brainstorm List (15 min)

Create a personal list of 15 potential unreasonable hospitality moments:
- 5 that cost nothing
- 5 that cost under $5
- 5 that are "above and beyond" gestures

This becomes your idea bank.

## Reflection Questions

1. An unreasonable hospitality moment is...
2. Today I created a moment for ___ by ___. Their reaction was ___.
3. Three opportunities I noticed but didn't act on (and why):
4. The difference between genuine and performative hospitality is...
5. One new idea I want to try next shift is...

# UNIT 3.6: DIFFICULT SITUATIONS BEYOND COMPLAINTS

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Office + floor role-play

## Purpose

Some situations go beyond simple complaints. This unit prepares Heming for scenarios that require judgment, tact, and sometimes escalation.

## Content to Cover

### Intoxicated Guests (30 min)

**Recognition Signs:**
- Slurred speech
- Unsteady walking
- Loud, boisterous behavior beyond normal
- Glassy eyes
- Ordering drinks rapidly
- Becoming argumentative

**The Approach:**

**Slow Service:**
- Delay drink delivery
- Offer food: "Can I get you some fries with that?"
- Bring water without asking
- Stretch time between rounds

**The Cut-Off:**
If needed, be firm but kind:
- "I think we've had a great time tonight—let me close this tab out for you"
- "I'm going to switch you to water for now—safety first"
- Never use the word "drunk"

**When to Get Help:**
- If they become aggressive
- If they insist on driving
- If you feel unsafe

**Manager Role:**
Managers handle confrontational cut-offs. Heming should get Demetri if guest pushes back.

### Disruptive Guests (20 min)

**Types:**
- Loud complainers disturbing others
- Arguments between guests
- Inappropriate behavior
- Harassment of staff

**De-escalation:**
- Stay calm, speak quietly (they often match your volume)
- Acknowledge their frustration
- Move them away from other guests if possible
- Offer solution, not argument

**When to Escalate:**
- Any threat of violence
- Harassment doesn't stop
- Other guests are affected
- Your safety feels threatened

### Guest Injuries (20 min)

**Immediate Response:**
1. Ensure guest safety (don't move them if serious)
2. Get Demetri immediately
3. Offer first aid if minor (band-aids, ice)
4. Never admit liability ("I'm so sorry this happened" ≠ "It's our fault")

**Documentation:**
- Incident report completed SAME DAY
- What happened, when, where, who witnessed
- Guest contact information
- Photos if relevant

**Incident Report Form:**
Review the blank incident report form. Practice completing one for a hypothetical scenario.

### Payment Issues (15 min)

**Card Declined:**
- Quietly: "This card isn't going through—do you have another one we can try?"
- Never announce loudly
- Offer to try again or use different card
- If no payment possible: Get Demetri

**Walkouts:**
- If you see someone leaving without paying: Don't chase into parking lot
- Note description, inform manager immediately
- Check cameras
- Document

**Disputes:**
- "I didn't order that" → Check ticket, apologize, remove if genuinely wrong
- "I was charged wrong" → Review receipt together, correct if error
- Major disputes → Get Demetri

### "I Want to Speak to a Manager" (15 min)

**Not Always Bad:**
Sometimes they want to compliment. Sometimes they have a request only a manager can handle.

**When to Handle Yourself:**
- Complaint you can fix
- Question you can answer
- Issue within your authority

**When to Get Demetri:**
- They specifically request manager
- Issue is beyond your authority
- You've tried and they're still upset
- Any legal/liability concern

**The Handoff:**
"Absolutely, let me get Demetri for you. She'll take great care of you."
Brief Demetri before they arrive at the table.

### Online Review Mentions (15 min)

When a guest says: "I'm going to leave a bad review"

**Don't:**
- Panic
- Get defensive
- Make promises you can't keep
- Match their hostility

**Do:**
- "I'm really sorry we've let you down. Can you tell me what happened so I can try to make it right?"
- Escalate to Demetri
- Document what happened
- Try to resolve before they leave

**The Goal:**
Turn the experience around so they have no reason to leave a bad review—or update it later.

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Scenario Role-Play (45 min)

Practice each difficult situation:

1. **Intoxicated guest wants another drink**
2. **Table is being very loud, bothering other guests**
3. **Guest says they slipped on a wet floor**
4. **Card declined, guest is embarrassed**
5. **Guest says "I want to speak to your manager" (angry)**
6. **Guest says "I'm leaving a one-star review right now"**

For each: Practice response, then debrief.

### Activity 2: Incident Report Practice (15 min)

Complete an incident report for this scenario:

"A guest tripped over a chair leg while walking to the bathroom. They fell and scraped their knee. Another guest helped them up. The injured guest says they're fine but seems shaken."

Complete the form. Review with Demetri.

### Activity 3: Cut-Off Script Practice (15 min)

Practice the intoxication cut-off conversation:
- The soft approach (slowing service)
- The firm approach (closing their tab)
- Handling pushback

## Reflection Questions

1. Signs of intoxication include...
2. If a guest's card is declined, I will...
3. If a guest says "I'm going to leave a bad review," I should...
4. I should immediately get Demetri when...
5. An incident report should include...
