# UNIT 5.1: SHIFT LEADERSHIP FUNDAMENTALS

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Office + Floor

## Purpose

Define what it means to be Manager on Duty and establish the foundational skills of shift leadership.

## Content to Cover

### The MOD Role (30 min)

**What It Means:**
- You are responsible for everything that happens during your shift
- You set the tone—your energy becomes the team's energy
- You make decisions in the moment
- You protect standards AND care for people

**What It Doesn't Mean:**
- You're "the boss" who orders people around
- You do everything yourself
- You're untouchable or unapproachable
- You have to know everything (asking questions is smart)

**The Mindset:**
"I am responsible for our guests' experience, my team's success, and protecting Jayna's standards. If something goes wrong, I fix it or escalate it. If something goes right, I recognize it."

### Setting the Tone (20 min)

**Your Energy Becomes the Team's Energy:**
- Walk in stressed → team feels stressed
- Walk in positive → team feeds off it
- Walk in checked out → team checks out

**How to Set Positive Tone:**
- Greet every team member by name when you arrive
- Brief check-in: "How's your day going?"
- Address concerns quickly (don't let negativity fester)
- Model the behavior you expect
- Stay visible—don't hide in the office

**During Stressful Moments:**
- Stay calm externally (even if stressed internally)
- Clear communication: "Here's what we're doing"
- Thank people in the moment: "Great hustle on that rush"

### The Pre-Shift Meeting (45 min)

**Purpose:**
- Alignment: Everyone knows what's happening today
- Information: Specials, 86s, VIPs, goals
- Motivation: Start the shift on a high note
- Connection: Team feels unified

**Structure (5-10 minutes max):**

1. **Quick Wins / Recognition (1-2 min)**
   - Shout out great work from recent shifts
   - Celebrate birthdays, milestones
   - Start positive

2. **Sales Goal / Focus (1 min)**
   - What's our target today?
   - What are we pushing? (feature cocktail, dessert, wine)
   - Keep it simple, specific

3. **Operational Updates (2-3 min)**
   - 86'd items
   - Specials
   - VIPs or reservations
   - Any equipment issues
   - Staffing notes (who's coming in late, etc.)

4. **Focus Area (1-2 min)**
   - One thing to emphasize today
   - Examples: "Five-Second Rule," "Table touches," "Upselling dessert"
   - Why it matters

5. **Team Hands-In (30 sec)**
   - End with energy
   - "Let's have a great shift—hands in!"
   - Quick break, everyone disperses

**What NOT to Do:**
- Ramble beyond 10 minutes
- Only share negatives
- Skip it because you're "too busy"
- Read from notes robotically

### Delegation That Works (30 min)

**The Components of Clear Delegation:**

1. **Clear Task**
   - What exactly needs to be done?
   - "Stock the to-go station" not "make sure we're stocked"

2. **Expected Outcome**
   - What does success look like?
   - "100% full, neat, nothing expired"

3. **Timeline**
   - By when?
   - "Before the dinner rush" or "in the next 30 minutes"

4. **Check for Understanding**
   - "Does that make sense?"
   - "Any questions?"

5. **Follow-Up**
   - Actually check that it got done
   - Acknowledge completion: "Thanks—looks great"

**Example:**
❌ "Can you take care of the bathrooms?"
✅ "Can you do a full bathroom reset—check supplies, wipe everything down, make sure it's guest-ready—in the next 20 minutes? Let me know when it's done."

**Common Delegation Mistakes:**
- Assuming they know what you mean
- Not following up (they think you don't care)
- Doing it yourself because "it's faster"
- Delegating without authority (then micromanaging)

### Situational Awareness (20 min)

**Eyes Everywhere:**
As MOD, you're not focused on one task—you're scanning constantly.

**What to Monitor:**
- Guest experience: Are people being greeted? Happy? Waiting?
- Team: Is anyone struggling? Overwhelmed? Checked out?
- Kitchen: Tickets backing up? Communication flowing?
- Bar: Backed up? Running low?
- Cleanliness: Anything a guest would notice?

**The 5-Minute Sweep:**
Every 5-10 minutes, do a quick mental check:
- Guests: All good?
- Team: All good?
- Kitchen: All good?
- Bar: All good?
- Anything I need to address?

### Decision-Making Framework (15 min)

When facing a decision you're unsure about:

**Step 1: Ask "What would Demetri do?"**
If you know, do it.

**Step 2: Ask "What serves the guest and team?"**
Usually the right answer is clear.

**Step 3: Ask "Can I explain this decision?"**
If you can clearly explain your reasoning, you're probably right.

**Step 4: If still unsure, ask.**
Text Demetri. Call. No shame in checking.

**The Bias:**
When in doubt, err on the side of:
- Taking care of the guest
- Supporting the team
- Protecting standards

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Observe Pre-Shift Meetings (2-3 shifts)

Watch Demetri run pre-shift meetings:
- Note the structure
- Note the energy
- Note team response

### Activity 2: Write a Pre-Shift Meeting Outline

Create an outline for tomorrow's pre-shift:
- Recognition
- Sales goal
- Updates
- Focus area
- Closing

### Activity 3: Deliver a Practice Pre-Shift

Deliver the meeting to Demetri (role-playing as the team):
- Get feedback
- Adjust and try again

## Reflection Questions

1. The Manager on Duty is responsible for...
2. My pre-shift meeting structure will be...
3. When delegating, I should always include...
4. If I'm unsure about a decision, I will...
5. Setting the tone means...

# UNIT 5.2: COACHING & ACCOUNTABILITY

**Duration:** 3-4 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Office + Floor

## Purpose

Great managers develop people. This unit teaches Heming to coach effectively—both celebrating wins and addressing issues.

## Content to Cover

### Coaching vs. Managing (20 min)

**Managing:** Directing tasks, ensuring completion
- "Do this."
- "Is that done?"
- Focus: Task

**Coaching:** Developing capability, building people
- "Here's why this matters."
- "What would you do differently?"
- Focus: Growth

**The Goal:**
Don't just tell people what to do—help them understand WHY and develop their own judgment.

### Positive Reinforcement (30 min)

**Why It Matters:**
- People repeat what gets noticed
- Recognition builds loyalty
- Specific praise teaches what "good" looks like

**How to Do It Right:**

**Be Specific:**
❌ "Good job today"
✅ "The way you handled that complaint was perfect—you apologized immediately and had the food remaking before they finished talking"

**Be Timely:**
In the moment > Later > Never

**Be Public (When Appropriate):**
Recognition in front of peers amplifies impact

**Be Genuine:**
Forced praise feels worse than no praise

**Examples:**
- "I saw how you greeted that family with kids—you made them feel welcome right away"
- "Your bar setup was spotless today. That's the standard."
- "You've really improved on your expo speed—I've noticed"

### Corrective Feedback (45 min)

**The Challenge:**
Correction feels uncomfortable, but avoiding it breeds mediocrity.

**When to Give:**
- Task not completed to standard
- Behavior doesn't match expectations
- Pattern emerging that needs addressing
- Before it becomes a bigger issue

**How to Give:**

**Private:**
Never correct in front of guests or peers (unless safety issue)

**Prompt:**
Address soon, not days later

**Specific:**
"When you did X, the impact was Y"

**Behavior-Focused:**
Attack the behavior, not the person
❌ "You're careless"
✅ "When silverware is left spotted, guests notice"

**Forward-Looking:**
"Here's what I need next time"

**Check Understanding:**
"Does that make sense? Any questions?"

**The Formula:**
1. State what you observed (factual)
2. Explain the impact
3. State what you expect
4. Check understanding
5. Express confidence

**Example:**
"Hey, I noticed the bathrooms weren't checked during your shift—there was no toilet paper in one stall. When that happens, guests have a bad experience and think we don't care. I need you to check bathrooms every hour during your shift. Does that make sense? I know you'll nail it next time."

### Handling Pushback (20 min)

**When They Disagree:**

**Stay Calm:**
Don't match their energy if they get defensive.

**Listen:**
Maybe they have context you don't.

**Acknowledge, Then Redirect:**
"I hear you. And here's what I still need..."

**Hold the Standard:**
Don't back down on non-negotiables.

**Example:**
Team member: "I did check the bathrooms—someone must have used it after."
You: "I hear you, and that happens. The solution is checking more frequently, especially during dinner rush. Can you commit to that?"

### When Coaching Isn't Working (15 min)

**Signs:**
- Same issue repeated after coaching
- Attitude doesn't change
- Excuses instead of ownership
- Other team members noticing

**Escalation Path:**
1. Informal coaching (conversation)
2. Documented coaching (accountability form)
3. Formal disciplinary action (verbal → written → final)
4. Termination (if pattern continues)

**When to Escalate:**
- Third occurrence of same issue
- Refusal to accept feedback
- Impact on team or guests
- Any serious violation

**Document Everything:**
Even informal coaching—note it. Patterns matter.

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: Positive Feedback Role-Play (15 min)

Give specific positive feedback for:
- Great guest interaction
- Excellent closing job
- Helping a struggling teammate

### Activity 2: Corrective Feedback Role-Play (20 min)

Practice correcting:
- Closing task skipped
- Late to shift
- Rude to a teammate

Demetri plays defensive team member. Heming practices handling pushback.

### Activity 3: Observe Real Coaching (When available)

Watch Demetri coach a team member:
- Note approach
- Note language
- Note outcome

## Reflection Questions

1. Good coaching is specific because...
2. I should give corrective feedback in private because...
3. If a team member gets defensive, I will...
4. The difference between coaching and disciplinary action is...
5. Signs that coaching isn't working include...

# UNIT 5.5: JUDGMENT & DECISION-MAKING

**Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Trainer:** Demetri  
**Location:** Office

Define the boundaries of Heming's authority. What can she handle? What needs Demetri?

## Content to Cover

### The Autonomy Spectrum (30 min)

**Full Autonomy (Handle Yourself):**
- Guest recovery/comps up to $50
- Coaching conversations
- Schedule adjustments day-of (within coverage)
- Operational fixes and troubleshooting
- Sending someone home if clearly needed (sick, intoxicated, fighting)
- Normal complaint handling
- Catering inquiries (up to confirmation)

**Consult Demetri:**
- Comps over $50

- Suspensions
- Any injury beyond minor first aid
- Threats or violence
- Legal concerns
- Media inquiries
- Anything involving alcohol/liability
- Health department visits

### The "Explain It to Demetri" Test (20 min)

**Before making a decision, ask:**
"If Demetri asked me why I did this, could I explain my reasoning clearly?"

If YES → Proceed
If MAYBE → Proceed cautiously, document well
If NO → Ask first

**Examples:**

Situation: Guest's food took 25 minutes, they're visibly frustrated.
Your decision: Comp the meal.
Can you explain it?: Yes—service recovery, guest was clearly unhappy, comping shows we care.
→ Proceed

Situation: Employee asks to leave 2 hours early for "personal reasons."
Your decision: Let them go.
Can you explain it?: Maybe—depends on coverage. If we're covered, probably fine. If we're short, risky.
→ Check coverage, make judgment call, document why.

Situation: Someone asks about writing a review for a news article.
Your decision: Give interview.
Can you explain it?: No—this could have implications you don't understand.
→ Escalate immediately.

### Scenario Practice (45 min)

Rapid-fire: 15 situations, Heming says "my call" or "ask Demetri"

1. Guest wants a refund for takeout from yesterday
2. Server asks to swap shifts with another server
3. Cook calls in sick 30 minutes before their shift

11. Vendor shows up with wrong order
12. Team member is crying in the back
13. Guest is visibly intoxicated
14. Someone from the newspaper calls
15. Catering order of $2000 comes in

**Debrief:** Discuss the reasoning for each answer.

### Building Judgment Over Time (15 min)

**How Good Judgment Develops:**
- Experience: You learn from situations
- Feedback: Demetri tells you when you got it right/wrong
- Pattern recognition: Similar situations = similar responses
- Reflection: Thinking about what worked

**Accelerating Learning:**
- When Demetri makes a decision, ask WHY
- After you make a call, evaluate the outcome
- Don't be afraid to ask—that's learning, not weakness
- Document your reasoning—review later

## Hands-On Activities

### Activity 1: 15 Scenarios (Verbal)

Rapid-fire exercise described above.
Goal: Demonstrate judgment, explain reasoning.

### Activity 2: Create Personal Escalation Guide

Document for quick reference:
