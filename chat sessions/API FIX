PERFECT! NOW I SEE THE ISSUE!

  Looking at your Toast web data:

  The Key Numbers:

  From Toast Web:
  - Net sales: $45,814.43 ← This is what we should show
  - Total payments: $53,133.66 ← This is what our API is calculating
  - Difference: $7,319.23

  Payment breakdown (matches our API almost exactly):
  - Credit/debit: $36,659.45 ✅
  - Cash: $2,239.54 ✅
  - Other: $14,171.87 (our API: $14,208.57, diff: $36.70)
  - Gift Card: $62.80 ✅

  ---
  THE PROBLEM:

  Our API is calculating net sales by summing payment amounts, but Toast calculates net sales from the Orders endpoint using check amounts.

  Toast's Net Sales Calculation:
  Net Sales = Gross Sales - Discounts - Refunds
  Net Sales = $46,528.15 - $467.65 - $246.07 = $45,814.43

  Our API's Calculation:
  Net Sales = Credit + Cash + Other + Gift Cards
  Net Sales = $36,659.45 + $2,239.54 + $14,208.57 + $62.80 = $53,170.36

  ---
  WHY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE:

  Total payments ($53,133.66) includes:
  - Timing differences ("Paid in total" = $4,011.75 for orders from previous periods)
  - Possibly other accounting adjustments
  - Different date/time basis (payment processed time vs check open time)

  Net sales ($45,814.43) is:
  - Pure revenue from orders in this period
  - Based on check amounts (what was actually ordered and paid, minus discounts/refunds)

  ---
  THE FIX:

  This is a known issue already documented in CLAUDE.md (lines 216-223):

  // ✅ CORRECT - Toast's official calculated total
  const netSales = check.amount; // Already includes discounts & service charges

  // ❌ WRONG - Summing payments (inflated 3.4x in testing)
  const netSales = payments.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.amount, 0);

  Our current API (toast-sales-summary.js v7.5) uses the Payments endpoint, but it should use the Orders endpoint with check.amount.

  ---
  SOLUTION:

  We need to rewrite the API to:

  1. Fetch orders (not just payments) using /orders/v2/ordersBulk
  2. Use check.amount to calculate net sales (not payment amounts)
  3. Still use payments endpoint for tip breakdown by card type

  This will give us the correct $45,814.43 that matches Toast web exactly.

  Should I implement this fix now? It will require rewriting the toast-sales-summary.js API endpoint to use orders instead of payments.

> WHY DOT YOU CREATE A NEW API WITH THESE CORRECTIONS BASED ON THE ORIGINAL API JS FILE SO WE CAN TEST IT FIRST TO REALLY MAKE SURE. COPY THE JS FILE T A NEW 
FILE AND THEN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS, WE WILL TEST IT HERE 

⏺ Perfect! Let me create a new API file based on the original, make the corrections, and we'll test it here in the terminal.

      counter/jayna-cash-c…)
