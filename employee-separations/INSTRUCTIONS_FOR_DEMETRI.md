## IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA LAW REMINDERS

### Timing of Final Pay
- **If you terminated her:** Pay must be given IMMEDIATELY (today)
- **If she quit with 72+ hours notice:** Pay on her last day
- **If she quit without notice:** Within 72 hours

**⚠️ WAITING TIME PENALTIES:** If you're late with final pay, you may owe her continuing wages as a penalty!

### You CANNOT Deduct from Final Pay
- Cannot deduct for unreturned uniforms
- Cannot deduct for cash drawer shortages
- Cannot deduct for damaged equipment
- **Exception:** Only court-ordered deductions (child support, garnishments) or deductions she authorized in writing

If she doesn't return company property, you'll need to pursue it separately - you cannot withhold her final pay.

## WHAT TO SAY (Sample Script)

*"Savanah, I have your final paycheck here for $364.22. This includes all wages through [final work date]. I need you to sign these two documents acknowledging receipt of your final pay and that you understand your employment has ended.*

*The first document confirms you received your final check. The second provides important information about unemployment benefits, health insurance continuation, and your rights under California law.*

*Please review both documents, check the boxes, and sign where indicated. Do you have any questions?*

*Also, I need to collect [list any company property - uniforms, keys, etc.]."*

---

## IF SHE REFUSES TO SIGN

**DO NOT WITHHOLD HER PAY!**

1. Give her the paycheck anyway
2. Give her copies of the documents
3. Write on your copies: "Employee refused to sign [date]"
4. Have a witness present if possible
5. Have witness sign noting the refusal

You cannot force her to sign, but you must still give her the final pay on time.
